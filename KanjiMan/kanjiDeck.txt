一	one	One		One down, 2041 to go. ;).	To learn this one kanji, I recommend (#2000) this story : Bambi is in a cave, eating a side-dish of salad when trying to learn the kanjis. As he succeed to learn the kanji for "one", you get jealous and decide to shoot him with a slingshot. At this moment you hear the police coming, so you hurriedly burn all the proofs into a fire (so you remove the key-words Bambi, slingshot and fire from recommend). So that when the police arrives, the only remaining clue is a single horizontal bar.	
二	two	two		Two lines.	Roman numeral II, written on its side.	<img src="二.png">
三	three	three		One + two = three.	THREE measurements define the female shape: BUST, WAIST, and HIPS. Waist is the smallest, and for most women the HIPS are wider than the chest.	<img src="三.png">
四	four	four, pent in, human legs		FOUR year-olds often put their FOOT (human legs) in their MOUTH - but they are too young to realize.	I imagine a giant devouring a human in four bites. First the giant bites off the person´s head, then he bites the torso, then from the waist to the knees, and finally the giant plucks up the remaining portion of the human legs into his mouth. See the fourth bite falling in there?	<img src="四.png">
五	five	five		三 + two vertical lines = 5.	This Kanji looks like a "3" Kanji with two added vertical lines. 3+2= 5.	<img src="五.png">

十	ten	ten, needle		Two needles crossing marks the spot, or you can use the Roman character for ten (rotated 45 degrees).	I scared away ten vampires with a single cross!	<img src="十.png">
口	mouth	mouth		Looks like a huge open mouth.	Momma used to say: "Keep your trap shut!" This thing is shaped like a trap door.	<img src="口.png">
日	day	day, sun		Open the window, new day.	Picture two halves of a 24-hr period: Day & Night.	<img src="日.png">
月	month	month, moon, month, flesh, part of the body		A month is longer than a day.	Am I the only one who sees this as someone sticking their ass in the air "mooning" someone (two cheeks of the butt and the legs coming off of it)? The Moon meaning connects well to the meaning of month, considering that months were traditionally measured by the phases of the moon. Also, the mooning "ass" part of it connects well to Hesig´s seemingly unconnected "flesh" or "part of the body" meaning (when used in primitive form).	<img src="月.png">
田	rice field	rice field, brains		A rice field divided into four parts.	Ten people use their mouths to eat the yield of the rice fields.	<img src="田.png">

朋	companion	companion, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, moon2, month2, flesh2, part of the body2		My companion and I are like two moons side by side.	Under the twin moons of Tatooine, Luke had no COMPANION.	<img src="朋.png">

世	generation	generation, ten, twenty	Three <b>tens</b>. Makes sense, as a generation is about 30 years.	3 tens = generation.	They SAY a generation is ten+ten+ten years, with the big first ten providing a grounding, and the next ten providing a little more grounding for the final ten. But I wish the next generation didn´t always SAY "yo!". (ON reading is SEI, KUN reading is yo).	<img src="世.png">
胃	stomach	stomach, rice field, brains, moon, month, flesh, part of the body		The rice field is harvested once a month to get food for our stomach.	The stomach is the part of the body that digests food (which, in Japan, is mainly rice).	<img src="胃.png">
旦	daybreak	nightbreak, sun, one, floor	Sun above the horizon	A nightbreak happens when the sun rises over the horizon (floor).	It may be easier to think of the keyword "DAYBREAK" or "MORNING" for this kanji (other kanji dictionaries do). Then the mnemonic phrase "SUN rising over the HORIZON" works better. It is an infrequent kanji, but can be found in: 旦夕　（たんせき） morning and evening, or 元旦　（がんたん） New Year´s Day.	<img src="旦.png">
胆	gall bladder	gallbladder, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, nightbreak, sun, day, one, floor	No idea.	The moon has a lot of gall sticking around after sunrise.	All the month long I have to start working at nightbreak. This really activates my gall bladder (=I get angry).	<img src="胆.png">

Like the roman numeral for one... oneself	Faced with his clone, our hero valiantly cut a mark on his forehead right above his eye so that his comrades could tell his true oneself from the enemy.	To use an eyedropper by oneself, aim from above to put a drop into the eye.	<img src="自.png">

This kanji does not mean "get up" or "awake." It means rising, like the rising of a salary, or a promotion. STORY: You know that your salary has RISEN UP when your MEASURING BOX has enough dollar bills in it to reach the SUN.	We Measure the Sun to decide when we should Rise Up out of bed.	<img src="昇.png">
丸	round	round, drop, nine, baseball	Add a <b>drop</b>&nbsp;to <b>nine</b>&nbsp;and <b>round</b>&nbsp;it to ten.	Nine plus a drop rounds it off to ten!	Watch out for plump (#120). Here Heisig could have added a "t" and we would have had a much better keyword : rotund. Rotund is more specific than "round" which begs for confusion with circle (#1811). A dictionary search on "fat" or "round" doesn´t yield this kanji, but "rotund" does! Primitive suggestion: the Laughing Buddha is often depicted as a rotund, smiling bald man in robes with a largely exposed pot belly stomach (symbolizing plenitude).	<img src="丸.png">

博	Dr.	Dr., ten, needle, acupuncturist, specialty, drop, ten, needle, rice field, brains, glue	<b>Needle speciality </b>= <b>doctor</b>. 'Nuff said.	Ten specialties grants you the title of Dr. with a dot.	Watch for doctor (#1694), the sooner the better! In fact this kanji refers to someone well "learned", with extensive knowledge. This could apply to any kind of field. The kanji 医 ("doctor") is directly related to medicine. I would suggest to take away completely the idea of medicine here, and use a popular character whose name includes the keyword such as "Dr. Who", "Dr. Jekyll", even "Dr. Dobb´s" if you´re into programming.	<img src="博.png">

Indiana Jones jumps up and grabs the lip of cliff just in time to evade the huge STONE rolling out of the mouth of the cave!	There´s a VERY simple way to remember this, in case the cliff thing isn´t working for you... Just see it as a stone [いし] being hammered by a miner searching for jewel stones [ほうせき] ;).	<img src="石.png">
砕	smash	smash, stone, rock, ninety, nine, baseball, ten, needle	To <b>smash</b>&nbsp;a <b>stone</b>&nbsp;will take <b>nine </b>or&nbsp;<b>ten</b>&nbsp;tries.

砂	sand	sand, stone, rock, few	If you break a <b>rock</b> into a <b>few</b> pieces, it will eventually be <b>sand</b>.	Here´s how I remember that stone is on the left. This is because sand starts as stones, and only later they become few.	In good SAND, stones are few, if any.	<img src="砂.png">
削	shave	plane, resemblance, spark, candle, small, little, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, sword, sabre, saber	Just imagine using a <b>spark blade</b> (lightsaber) to <b>shave</b> with.

Success (or survival?) method for accelerated juggling course: focus on a few nitroglycerine filled juggling balls flying OVER your eyes ---(I have trouble with this few primitive that can be anywhere in a kanji. To build in its location in the story is important somehow).	<img src="省.png">
厚	thick	thick, cliff, sun, day, child	A parent<b>&nbsp;</b>would have to be pretty <b>thick</b>&nbsp;to leave their <b>kid</b>&nbsp;in the <b>sun</b>&nbsp;under a <b>cliff</b>.

奇	strange	strange, large, St. Bernard, can, mouth, street, nail, spike	Dogs can be strange	I find it strange that so many people commit suicide in Tokyo by throwing themselves in front of the train. To me when I look at this kanji, I see a train just about to come out of a tunnel, and above the man waiting for his oppourtunity where he can end it all.	Imagine a ST. BERNARD DOG carrying a CAN instead of a barrel in rescue missions. How strange!	<img src="奇.png">
川	stream	stream, flood		So as not to confuse this with river (#146) think of streamers falling down.	There are three default I/O Streams in UNIX, stdin, stdout, and stderr.	<img src="川.png">
州	state	state, stream, flood, drops	Little islands in the stream all call themselves individual <b>states</b>.	There were 3 little islands in the stream who all decided to set themselves up as independent states.	シュウ　The original meaning of this character was "sandbar", and for me this conjures up images of the Mississippi River, which is very wide with many sandbars and which was used to define the borders in ten American states. Picture Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer floating by state after state as they adventure down the mighty Mississippi, occasionally beaching their raft on sandbars.	<img src="州.png">

Obey, Obey! says the brain-washing scientist as he sends a stream of orders to fill your head.	Obey the orders streaming down from head office.	<img src="順.png">
水	water	water		The kanji for water is an abstract primitive itself, so unless one is willing to break down its etymological development, it should just simply be memorized by strokes; constructing a story is not necessarily useful unless it strongly denotes its shape (I find that Heisig´s story doesn´t do this).	For those having issues with this* "A 7K foot pool of water" Notice it looks like a 7, and a K. Might have to practice writing it a few times.	<img src="水.png">
氷	icicle	icicle, drop, water	<b>Drops</b>&nbsp;of <b>water</b>&nbsp;falling from an <b>icicle</b>.	Icicles start with 1 frozen drop of water.	A drop in temperature turns water into an icicle.	<img src="氷.png">

It takes but one drop from the most special water: the fountain of youth (and it is written in a special way to with an extra horizontal line on the top) to live for an eternity. (In order to remember that the drop is at the top, think that the drop must come from the topmost water in order for its effects to be true).	<img src="永.png">
泉	spring	spring, white, dove, water	<b>Spring</b>: <b>white water</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Ease peas.</div>	White is a symbol of purety, so white water is pure water, the precise definition of spring water.	Perhaps the most common appearance of this kanji is in the word 温泉 (おんせん, onsen), a Japanese hot spring. The kanji is an excellent image of someone enjoying a Japanese hot spring: a little white towel on top, water below. (This helps keep all associations: spring, little and onsen).	<img src="泉.png">
原	origin	meadow, cliff, spring, white, dove, small, little	The cliffs of Dover are a little white, which is the origin of their name	Follow the springs down the cliff and you will find a nice meadow.	Sorry about this, but Heisig was stupid calling this kanji meadow, used in composite words the most common meaning is ORIGIN... To remember just think that life may have begun in pounds or springs in a land with many cliffs ... Just to answer correctly the review lessons think of meadow as the origin of a huge forest.	<img src="原.png" />
願	petition	petition, meadow, cliff, white, dove, small, little, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	A petition page is the origin of change	Let´s petition to save that beautiful MEADOW from overdevelopment by signing on this PAGE.

"Elder brother gulped some water and said, ´What the hell was Heisig´s mental CONDITION when he came up with this definition? Heisig must have a drinking CONDITION. But of course, if Heisig sticks to water, rather than sake (like me, water quaffing, situation assessing, sober elder brother), his SITUATION may improve.´"　[MODEL COMPOUND: 状況　(じょうきょう)　state of affairs; conditions].	<img src="況.png">
河	river	river, water, water droplets, water pistol, can, street, nail, spike, mouth	<b>Water can</b> become a <b> river</b>	A river CAN exist only if there is WATER.	I kept confusing this with stream. My Japanese friend said that to him this is for an artificial river. Looking at kanji compounds with this there are two that struck me: One is the Yellow River in China (黄河), and the other is the Milky Way (銀河). Now I either think of the Little Engine that could dragging a bunch of stuff down a river in China and polluting it (so it turned yellow) or I see the Little Engine that Could flying across the sky making the Milky Way.	<img src="河.png">
泊	overnight	overnight, water, water droplets, water pistol, white, dove	A glass of <b>water</b>&nbsp;and <b>white sheets</b>&nbsp;is all you need to sleep <b>overnight</b>.

圧	pressure	pressure, cliff, soil, dirt, ground	A <b>cliff</b> crushes the <b>soil</b> below it with great <b>pressure</b>.	The GROUND at the base of a CLIFF must suffer from enormous pressure.	For physics people: p = F/A (p:pressure, F:Force, A:Area). Where the force is from the immensity of the cliff. The area on the cliff is covered by soil. So the equation becomes p = F/A = cliff/soil which preserves the position of the primitives.	<img src="圧.png">
埼	cape	cape, soil, dirt, ground, strange, large, St. Bernard, street, nail, spike, mouth	<b>Soil</b> in a <b>strange</b> shape could be called a <b>cape</b>.	This refers to LAND, not the STRANGE gear superheroes wear.	Cape Cod "odd" is a land where odd=strange things happen.

When the SUN starts to shine on the TEMPLE, it´s time to get up.	In ancient Japan, TIME of ´´day´´ was announced at the ´´buddhist temples´´. They did this by ringing large iron bells.

灰	ashes	ashes, cliff, fire	If the <b>cliff </b>shields your <b>fire </b>from the wind, there will definitely be <b>ashes</b> left over.	The fire underneath the cliff will eventually turn everything above to ashes.	Scene from "The Big Lebowski" : Walter scatters Donny´s ashes, but a wind blows much of the ashes into "The Dude" Lebowski´s face. Upset, The Dude lashes out at Walter. Walter apologizes and hugs The Dude, before suggesting "Fuck it, man. Let´s go bowling." I bet you that The Dude wanted to cremate (fire) Walter right there and then, at the top of the cliff!

漁	fishing	fishing, water, water droplets, water pistol, fish, bound up, rice field, brains, oven-fire, barbecue	If there is <b>water</b> with <b>fish</b> in it, you can go <b>fishing</b>.	You need WATER and FISH for fishing.

里	ri	ri, computer, rice field, brains, soil, dirt, ground	The <b>ri</b> is a Japanese way of measuring the area of the <b>ground</b> underneath a <b>rice field</b>.	The ri is a Japanese way of measuring the area of the GROUND underneath a RICE FIELD.	Hint: Heisig makes here a severe disservice to everyone by using a weird keyword for this character.

埋	bury	bury, soil, dirt, ground, computer	Soil won't help you bury your computer search history.	You can´t bury computers underground, because of the dangerous heavy metals, so you hide them behind an equally large mound of soil and hope no-one notices.

安	relax	relax, house, woman	A <b>woman </b>can rarely <b>relax</b>&nbsp;in her <b>house</b>.	It´s funny, Hesig gives no Kanji in his book that means cheap/inexpensive... well... if you were wondering what Kanji would carry that meaning, look no further. Sometimes I wonder if Hesig just thinks our little brains would be too easily confused by multiple meanings. Regardless, think of that woman relaxing. Cheapest place to do that is in one´s own home rather than at some fancy resort, eh? 家で休暇を取るは安いですね。.	You can only relax, when you have woman under roof to do all chores.	<img src="安.png">

富	wealth	wealth, house, wealth, one, ceiling, mouth, rice field, brains	If you have <b>wealth</b>, you can buy a <b>rice field</b> to feed all the <b>mouths</b> in <b>one house</b>.

In ancient Japan, a RICE FIELD is a unit of wealth as it can produce enough to feed all the MOUTHs in ONE HOUSE.	<img src="富.png">

In Japan, a paulownia (きり）is known as the "princess tree". It was once a traditional TREE planted at the SAME time as the birth of a daughter. It would grow fast enough that, at the time of her wedding, it could be used to make a dresser as a wedding present for her.	Paulownia is a Japanese tree which looks same as any other tree.	<img src="桐.png">

If you´ve ever played an old 8 bit or 16 bit RPG, like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy or Inindou, you´ll remember that every town was all bordered off by a line of trees with no space in between to get out through. Imagine that the trees were glued together so you could only exit town through the main or side gates, (so you couldn´t escape the important scripted scenes.).	Pfft. At it´s core, a town is just a bunch of wood glued together. Edit - Stop starring this piece of crap story! xD.	<img src="村.png">
相	inter-	inter-, tree, wood, eye	You can see an <b>eye</b> of someone peeping out, having <b>inter-</b>course behind a tree	The prime minister is having inter-course behind that tree! All you can see are his eyes poking out from the righthand-side of the tree.	ソウ/ショウ/あ INTER /MUTUAL /ASPECT /PHASE /MINISTER. "Long ago, before there were telephones, people living far from one another would climb trees to eye each other´s aspects and inter-act for their mutual benefit.

札	tag	tag, tree, wood, fishhook	Learn the names of <b>trees</b> by <b>hooking tags&nbsp;</b>on them.	Botanists like to identify TREEs by HOOKing tags on them.	Might be good to note that this is also the Kanji for "Paper Money" w/ the reading さつ (千円札＝1000 Yen paper bill)... It also takes on the meaning of Playing Card with the reading of ふだ as in 花札 (Hanafuda cards) or トランプの札 ("trump" playing cards). For the tag meaning I like to think of wooden tags hung on hooks from trees... but for these other meanings I like to think of both paper money and playing cards as paper (tree) products with the ability to "hook you in" so to speak.	<img src="札.png">
案	plan	plan, relax, house, woman, tree, wood	I <b>plan</b> to take this <b>woman</b> to my <b>house</b> to sit on my <b>wood</b>.	I plan to RELAX on top of that TREE.

Tip: goods + wood/tree : This combination of primitives appears four times in Heisig, so it´s worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest "furniture" (a common type of wooden goods). REF: parch (FRAME 215) , maneuver (#671), winding (#1369), seaweed (#2035). Story: It´s been so parched recently that your furniture suddenly catches fire.	The parchment says you need fire to make goods from trees.	
未	not yet	not yet, tree, wood, one	<img src='maxresdefault.jpg'/>	I believe a better version of that by mameha1977: [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree (木) does not yet (未) have exremities (末) of vermilion (朱).		<img src="未.png">
末	extremity	extremity, tree, wood, one	The top branch of the <b>tree</b> sticks out like an <b>extremity</b>.	The tree has reached the extremity of its growth and no longer produces small, new branches at the top. Instead the existing top branch just grows longer and longer.	There are no great stories for this one yet, and I always forget it.. So, let´s try something ridiculous: The man lived by himself in the wilderness, with no females within miles. So, his only way of relief was to stick his extremity into a small hole in a tree.. The poor guy. Which horizontal stroke is the extremity? The longer one or the shorter one? That, my friends, is up to your own imaginations. I´d prefer not to dwell on that point, myself. ;).	<img src="末.png">
味	flavor	flavor, mouth, not yet, one, tree, wood	Food in the <b>mouth</b>, <b>not yet</b> swallowed to enjoy the <b>flavour</b>.

若	young	young, flowers, right, by one’s side, mouth	In Hawaii, if you wear a flower over your left ear, it means you are taken. A flower over the right means you are not.

Note This character belongs to a set of characters which share the flower/water primitive such as:: dilute (#227), fall (#299), clan (#1912), and seaweed (#2035).... (落 薄 藩 藻) It may be helpful to create a primitive keyword for this occurrence (like seaweed or watering can) which can save a lot of time distinguishing them from characters like Sino 満 and Full 満, where the water primitive is larger than the flower primitive.	
葉	leaf	leaf, flowers, Tarzan, generation, tree, wood	Each <b>flower generation</b> (year) of a <b>tree</b> will bring new <b>leaf</b>s.	On top of the leaves a flower appears, promising new generations for the old tree below.	The flower generation spent far too much time up trees trying to smoke leaves.	<img src="葉.png">

The gravedigger makes his LIVELIHOOD digging in the graveyard all day For graveyard, imagine an idyllic picture: beautiful grass with the sun shining down...and a dog peeing on one of the graves.

桃	peach tree	peach tree, tree, wood, portent, turtle	Which princess does the nasty turtle hide in the tree? Peach, of course	Portent Peach Tree<br>Princess Peach (tree), with bowser the turtle.	King Koopa consistently captures Princess Peach. Eventually he´s going to run out of castles and just set her in a tree.	<img src="桃.png">
眺	stare	stare, eye, portent, turtle	You won't win a staring contest with a turtle	Sauron´s One fiery eye stare at Frodo and it is a sign of portent. Evil will become whomever the eye is staring upon.	You lost a staring contest with a turtle because you blinked your eye before he did. (The contest wasn´t fair, because turtles have nictitating membranes, and don´t need to blink so often.) Eye comes first, because stare is most associated with eyes. And compare with challenge (#658) where this same obstreperous turtle challenges you to a finger wrestling contest. (Sibyl´s story with some notes that helped me).	<img src="眺.png">
犬	dog	dog, large, St. Bernard, drop		A large dog, dripping drool.	If we remember large (#107) as a man with his arms outstretched, the drop represents man´s best friend - a dog.	<img src="犬.png">

Your neighbor is so sick of you playing Led Zeppelin that he takes your copy of the song Black Dog and burns it. Finally, silence in the neighborhood.	
然	sort of thing	sort of thing, moon, crescent moon, month, flesh, part of the body, chihuahua, dog, large, drop, oven-fire, barbecue	The <b>flesh</b> of <b>dog</b> on a <b>fire</b>. That's the <b>sort of thing</b> they eat in Korea.	Flesh of a dog over a cooking fire = "hotdog". There are all sorts of things in hot dogs. Believe me, you don´t want to know what sort of things . Visualize the hotdog curling as it cooks, to remember the unusual way the flesh primitive curves in this kanji. (tweaked version of ziggr´s. Thanks!).	There are all sorts of things in hot dogs.

A famous philosopher once said that his world consisted of all the things he could jam into his brain.	<img src="界.png">
茶	tea	tea, flowers, umbrella, wooden pole	If you forget this one, ask Jess.	Some people think drinking tea is boring and quaint. That´s why I spice mine up by adding a cocktail umbrella, which of course is made from a wood-en toothpick supporting a paper umbrella with flowers printed on top.	When I drink herbal tea I like to drink it under a parasol. If it´s too hot I go "ho, ho, ho !!" (katakana ホ).	<img src="茶.png">

Pictograph-o-rama. This is a corner of a Japanese garden, with a small mound of soil on the left, and a little concrete pagoda in the front with flowers behind it.

Although this kanji´s meaning hasn´t caused me much trouble, I´ve had problems remembering the direction of the drop above king, since drops at tops of kanji often seem to appear in different directions.

Imagine an effeminate Roman 2000 years ago angling with a golden ladle instead of a rod because it matches his eyes and hair better and it impresses the boys. (Why a Roman?

[It´s been suggested on the forum (http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079) that flower across the full width of the kanji and water on the left below it should have its own keyword; seaweed is a popular choice. See also dilute (#227), clan (#1912), seaweed (#2035).

調	tune	tune, say, words, keitai, mouth, circumference, running track, soil, dirt, ground, mouth, mouth2	The other players were <b>talking</b> for the entire <b>lap</b> so I couldn't hear my favourite <b>tune</b>.	To tune an old-fashioned radio, you turn the dial the full range of the circumference, until you can clearly hear what´s being said.	words + circumference The most catchy tunes are words the go round and round the circuference of your head and you can´t get it out of your mind.	<img src="調.png">
談	discuss	discuss, say, words, keitai, mouth, inflammation, fire, fire2	<b>Words</b> can become <b>heated</b> when you <b>discuss</b> something.	Think of an online discussion group where misunderstanding someone´s words leads to flaming. An angry discussion = inflamed words.	Internet discussions often involve inflammatory words. Flame war!	<img src="談.png">
諾	consent	consent, say, words, keitai, mouth, young, flowers, by one’s side, mouth, mouth2	The <b>words</b> that the <b>young</b> girl said were definitely <b>consent</b>, your honour!	The words of the very young are useless without CONSENT from their elders.	Delores might say, "Yes!", but she´s way too young give any legal consent.	<img src="諾.png">
式	style	style, arrow, craft	Clothes <b>craft</b>ed out of <b>arrows</b> is the new <b>style</b>.	Each Indian tribe crafts their arrows in a certain style..	The latest style is shirts crafted out of arrows.	<img src="式.png">
試	test	test, say, words, keitai, mouth, style, arrow, craft	Your <b>words</b> must have <b>style</b> to pass the <b>test</b>.	In an essay test, you are judged on both your choice of words and your writing style.	The Japanese oral exam was a test of my speaking style.	<img src="試.png">
弐	II (two)	II, two, arrows, quiver	<b>One arrow</b> missed but <b>two</b> hit.	II (older form of writing 2). After shooting one arrow (the dash top left), I have 2 arrows left in my quiver (bottom left).	Once you have two old arrows left in your quiver, you better start running...!	<img src="弐.png">
域	range	range, soil, dirt, ground, pope, fiesta, mouth, one, floor	Hiding behind <b>soil</b> with your <b>head</b> just above the <b>ground</b>, checking your <b>spear</b>'s <b>range</b>.	An astronaut lands back at the launch range, kisses the earth beneath him with his mouth, then heads off to a fiesta to celebrate a safe flight.	Instead of Heisig´s "Fiesta" I use "Spear". Why? A spear is just a DROP extra on an Arrow. 域, range actually means range as in limits/boundary/border sort of range(In a box it was the old meaning for Country國 (581). Ok way too much etymology here, but back to story. With your SPEAR standing in a HOLE on the FLOOR with SOIL to its left9as you dug some out), you can see the RANGE of the spear in attacking a possible enemy (re Diablo and other RPGs, spear´s have range).	<img src="域.png">
賊	burglar	burglar, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, ten, needle, fiesta	The <b>shellfish</b> running off with <b>ten spears</b> is clearly a <b>burglar</b>.	Burglars... those guys!!! Burglars only want money (clams) so that they can get needles (drugs) and party (fiesta)!	After the fiesta, we found out that some burglar had stolen our money, probably breaking in with a lockpick needle...	<img src="賊.png">
栽	plantation	plantation, Thanksgiving, harvest festival, ten, needle, fiesta, tree, wood	<b>Ten spears</b> around your <b>tree</b> is the best way to protect your <b>plantation</b>.	The plantation is where we get our Christmas trees. We pick them out at Thanksgiving to be sure we get a good one.	During Thanksgiving, all the trees on the plantation celebrate the harvest. It´s a good time for them, too.	<img src="栽.png">

After eating a big Thanksgiving dinner, you have to be careful in the car ride home not to drop a load in your pants.	After ´Thanksgiving´ dinner, my girlfriend gave me a BJ on the drive back home.

茂	overgrown	overgrown, flowers, parade	The <b>flower parade</b> is just an <b>overgrown</b> mess.	The gay parade looks astonishing, as if overgrown with flowers.	When your garden gets OVERGROWN, it´s like the plants are mocking you. Here, you can see the roses actually parading around the yard, wilfully choking out the other, more docile plants. Then they actually go and parade down the street!	<img src="茂.png">
成	turn into	turn into, parade, sword, dagger	A <b>parade</b> of <b>knives</b> can quickly <b>turn into</b> something else entirely.	It only takes a single stroke of a dagger for a parade to TURN INTO a bloodbath.	The gay parade suddenly TURNED INTO a DAGGER throwing fight.	<img src="成.png">
城	castle	castle, soil, dirt, ground, turn into, parade, sword, dagger	The <b>soil</b> here was <b>turned into</b> a <b>castle</b>.	The sand castle is just the soil (#150) that turns into a castle.

威	intimidate	intimidate, march, women, woman	A <b>march</b> of <b>women</b> would <b>intimidate</b> anyone.	The march of women - against intimidation in the workplace - is pretty intimidating in itself!	Interesting that this kanji also has the meanings of "dignity" and "threaten." I can see how a march of women in Japan would be seen as intimidating by most men.	<img src="威.png">
滅	destroy	destroy, water, water droplets, water pistol, march, fire	Use your <b>water</b> spell on the <b>march</b> of <b>fire</b> monsters to <b>destroy</b> them.	Water flows down to destroy the march of fire.	Use a water cannon to destroy a line of marching fire monsters. I keep mixing this one up with disaster (#167) and demolition (#400). Remember, you DESTROY monsters (think of the Godzilla movie "Destroy All Monsters!"). Fires and floods are natural DISASTERs. And DEMOLITION is something you carefully do while wearing protective garments. (vaguely based on stefanot´s balrog story).	<img src="滅.png" />
減	dwindle	dwindle, water, water droplets, water pistol, march, mouth	Spray <b>water</b> on the <b>march</b> of <b>mouths</b> (protesters) until their numbers <b>dwindle</b>.

止	stop	stop, footprint		If you find in the ground a walking stick with a magic wand, STOP! Maybe it´s some kind of macumba/black magic/voodoo bad thing.	If you don´t remember this one from the 10,000,000 STOP signs on roads all over Japan, you´re beyyond help!	<img src="止.png">

When walking your pet, you must stop a few times along the way when nature calls.	When you learn to walk, you take your steps a few at a time.

I repeatedly walk around hoping this kanji will come into my head. I repeatedly walk around hoping this kanji will come into my head. I repeatedly walk around hoping this kanji will come into my head.	Are you familiar with the joke about the ditzy secretary who repeatedly walked back and forth forcibly over all the pages of her boss´ most important letters. When confronted she just says "Well you said they needed to be stamped before they´re mailed.".	<img src="頻.png">
肯	agreement	agreement, stop, footprint, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	When we first <b>step</b>ped on the <b>moon</b>, the government made an <b>agreement</b> with the aliens.	A secret agreement between a covert gov´t agency and aliens states that we will not step foot on the moon again in return for alien technology.	NASA and Armstrong made an agreement: They´d never tell anyone that no-one actually stepped foot on the moon.	<img src="肯.png">
企	undertake	undertake, umbrella, stop, footprint	Mary Poppins came down on an <b>umbrella</b> to <b>undertake</b> the job of <b>stop</b>ping the kids misbehaving.<br><br>I hate this story but it was so fucking stupid I accidentally remembered it.

武	warrior	warrior, one, arrow, stop, footprint	Just <b>one arrow</b> can <b>stop</b> a <b>warrior</b>.<br><br>"I used to be an adventurer like you..."	ONE-ARROW can STOP a warrior.	A great warrior can stop any 0pponent with one arrow.	<img src="武.png">
正	correct	correct, one, ceiling, stop, footprint		If you do it correct on the first attempt you can stop.	The correct way of learning Japanese? First, stop everything you´re doing. Then, go pick up a copy of Heisig´s book and work from there.	<img src="正.png">

政	politics	politics, correct, one, ceiling, stop, footprint, taskmaster	The <b>correct taskmaster</b> must be elected in <b>politics</b>.	Those involved in politics are always trying to elect the correct taskmaster.	Insane political correctness on the left, and facists taskmasters on the right- thats politics in a nutshell right there.	<img src="政.png">
定	determine	determine, house, mend	If your <b>house</b> needs <b>mend</b>ing, you have to be <b>determined</b> enough to do it.	In The Karate Kid, the boy must prove his determination by MENDING his teacher´s HOUSE in various ways.	People who decide to renovate (ooh, that´s a fancy word, let´s say "mend") their houses must be very determined DIYers. (Using DIY helps me remember this story when I see DEtermine).	<img src="定.png">
錠	lock	lock, metal, gold, determine, determined, house, mend	<b>Lock</b> up your <b>gold</b> if you're <b>determined</b> to keep it.	Even if you lock up your GOLD, a DETERMINED thief will get it in the end.	The best stories for this kanji tend to have a thief in them, which always makes me confuse them with the kanji for burglar (357). So, let´s try this one: My girlfriend wears a metal chastity belt with a lock but I am determined to open it! I must get inside!	<img src="錠.png">
走	run	run, soil, dirt, ground, mend	<b>10</b>km while <b>mending</b> the neighbourhood's monster problem. Just your daily <b>run</b> as part of being a hero for fun.	Hint: This kanji is NOT soil on top of mend, as Heisig claims - that would duplicate one of the strokes. Instead, it is 10 on top of mend. So my story is: If you run 10 miles, you will need to mend your socks!	The sports ground needs MENDING after the game as the players have been RUNNING around which has caused the ground to be chopped up.	<img src="走.png">
超	transcend	transcend, run, soil, dirt, ground, mend, summon, seduce, sword, dagger, mouth	<b>Saitama</b> shatters Sonic's <b>sword</b> with his <b>mouth</b>, because his strength has <b>transcend</b>ed all limits.	A successful marathon runner needs to be able to transcend seductions, such as the possibility of rest, shelter from the rain, or a cold beer.	To transcend oneself is to reach a higher plane of reality. A head shaven monk is telling me this. We are in a Tibetan monastery. He was once an athlete, a runner. He used to run everywhere, until one day, he saw a beautiful cheerleader along his path. She tried very hard to seduce him, but he forced himself to transcend his urges. He did reach his running goal, and he has became a lonely monk. He wishes now he had just broken down back then and....	<img src="超.png">
赴	proceed	proceed, run, soil, dirt, ground, mend, magic wand, augury	<b>Saitama</b> doesn't need a <b>magic wand</b> to <b>proceed</b>. He'll just punch a whole in the wall.

越	surpass	surpass, run, soil, dirt, ground, mend, parade	<b>Saitama</b> next to the <b>parade</b> of other heroes. He <b>surpasses</b> them all.	The person in charge of running the parade surpassed all our expectations (by just a extra drop...).	The parade of runners are all trying to SURPASS each other - and they end up running all the way to Vietnam (note that this kanji is also used for the country of Vietnam).	<img src="越.png">
是	just so	just so, sun, day, mend	The <b>sun</b> can <b>mend</b> things and make it all <b>just so</b>.	´Sun´ ´Mend´ - It just so happens that sunshine can mend your gloomy spirits.	My image here is of Fabrice (the guy who runs this website) spending all day obsessively mending the code so this page looks just so....	<img src="是.png">
題	topic	topic, just so, sun, day, mend, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	Positioned <b>just so</b> at the <b>head</b> of the page is the <b>topic</b>.	The "TOPIC" of the day´s newspaper must be placed JUST SO at the top of the PAGE to attract attention.	You spend ALL DAY, mending your socks JUST SO. Then you have a look at the HEADING of the newspaper. The topic---FREE SOCKS TO BE GIVEN AWAY!!!!	
堤	dike	dike, soil, dirt, ground, just so, sun, day, mend	Move the <b>soil just so</b> and you can make a <b>dike</b>.	Making a dike is all about arranging the soil just so....	The little Dutch boy has his finger stuck in the dike, and that´s the only thing keeping his town from going under. He really really needs to go to the bathroom though, so he devises a plan to carefully add a bit of dirt - there, place individual bits in just so - there, I think it´s good enough. Pull it out -----yes! Success!	<img src="堤.png">
建	build	build, brush, stretch	Use the <b>stretch</b> tool and the <b>brush</b> tool when <b>build</b>ing things on 3D CAD.	Build is easy to remember if you can remember that archtiechts have two steps in building. 1. Take a brush and brush out the blueprints. 2. Get a visual image of the blueprints all rolled up like they usually are. The second step is easy, it´s just the architecht stretching out the blueprints and showing it to his clients.	A construction worker´s classic morning. Stretch, brush his teeth, and then start to build.	<img src="建.png">
延	prolong	prolong, drop, stop, footprint, stretch	<b>Stretching correct</b>ly will <b>prolong</b> your life.	Stretching correctly prolongs life. Even the top part of 正 is stretching...	Here´s a great mnemonic: "stop, drop, and stretch (!?)." Now let´s associate it with ´prolong´: if you´re ever in an uncomfortable spot, like being asked tricky questions or caught in a lie, just PROLONG the situation - stop, drop, and stretch. They may be confused by your odd behaviour, but it´ll buy you a few moments to think up another good lie to get out of the sticky situation!	<img src="延.png">
誕	birth	nativity, say, words, keitai, mouth, prolonged, drop, stop, footprint, stretch	A women's <b>words</b> will be <b>prolonged</b> as she screams them when giving <b>birth</b>.	Nativity = born, being born. Think of birth as a painful and prolonged event. And of course, all the words and curses being yelled at the soon-to-be father for doing this to her!	When you are being born ( nativity ), your mother´s WORDS are PROLONGED. (Thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis huuuuuuuuuuuuuurtss a lottttttttt~!! Owwwwwww!!!).	<img src="誕.png">
礎	cornerstone	cornerstone, stone, rock, grove, tree, wood, zoo, critters, tree2, wood2	With a <b>stone</b> and two <b>trees</b> you can <b>mend</b> the <b>cornerstone</b> of this building.	Features like stones and groves of trees are the cornerstones of a happy zoo.	A zoo which is still under construction is already full of animals. At the moment, only the cornerstone has been set in place. To temporarily keep the animals from escaping, a closely-packed grove of small trees is planted around the stone. (Note that this zoo needs some serious mending.).	<img src="礎.png">
婿	bridegroom	bridegroom, woman, zoo, critters, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	The <b>woman</b> had to <b>mend</b> her <b>flesh</b> after the <b>bridegroom</b> had done with her.	The virgin bridegroom tries to understand the new, mysterious part of his woman´s body - but with little success. It´s a zoo down there! (primitives placement: the part of the body is ´down there´ - the woman is ´left´ unsatisfied).	The only reason anyone talks about a bridegroom is if they´re about to or have just gotten married. Of course, then you have to go on your honeymoon. So you take your woman to the zoo for a month. Pretty cool honeymoon.	<img src="婿.png">
衣	garment	garment, top hat, scarf, cloth, clothes, clothing, garment		The only garments allowed in this club are top hat and scarf.	The garments most commonly associated with the craft of a magician are the top hat and the magic wand. (It´s a stretch, but the way I remembered this kanji is through that phrase. This way you can remember it through using primitives we have already learned.).	<img src="衣.png">
裁	tailor	tailor, Thanksgiving, harvest festival, ten, needle, fiesta, top hat, scarf, cloth, clothes, clothing, garment	<b>Ten</b> needles (<b>spears</b>) to repair the <b>garment</b> was all the <b>tailor</b> needed.	The tailor was hard at work making sure all the pilgrims were dressed in their best garments for thanksgiving.	The tailor worked hard after thanksgiving to alter garments so they´d fit people who´d eaten too much at their thanksgiving dinners.	<img src="裁.png">
装	attire	attire, turtle, samurai, top hat, scarf, cloth, clothes, clothing, garment	The <b>robust</b> Puri-Puri Prisoner's <b>garments</b> are always his best <b>attire</b>. Because he's gay.	The TURTLE SAMURAI needs special GARMENTs for his ATTIRE since his body is much more ROBUST than others.	The ninja turtles tried to go eat at a fancy restaurant, but they were told to come back after their were dressed in proper attire. However, it´s too difficult for them to find proper garments because they bodies are so robust! (sannomiya + drwarrior12).	<img src="装.png">
裏	back	back, top hat, scarf, computer	<b>Top-hat computer's garment</b> is always open at the <b>back </b>- to allow access to the ports, of course.	The computer had carefully dressed up in clothes to look human. It was n´t until I looked at the back and saw the cables and stuff that I realized what it was.	Can computers be gay? I´m not sure, but mine always wears a top hat and scarf, and for some reason its back door port is always open...	<img src="裏.png">
壊	demolition	demolition, soil, dirt, ground, poltergeist, BernaE, ten, needle, eye, cross-eyed, net, top hat, scarf, cloth, clothes, clothing, garment	<b>Darth Vader</b> swinging his cape (<b>garment</b>) at a building and leaving naught but <b>soil</b> after the <b>demolition</b>.	If you stand too close to a DEMOLITION site, the dust might sting you like NEEDLES in your EYE and get your GARMENTs all dirty.	Since that needle eye thing turns up a lot, I turned it into Darth Vader. It kinda looks like him to me, with the eye being his metal mouth piece thing. So, Darth Vader swings his cape (his garment) demolishing a nearby building, leaving nothing but a pile of dirt.	<img src="壊.png">
哀	pathetic	pathetic, top hat, scarf, mouth	<b>Top-hat man's</b> other <b>garments</b> are all <b>pathetic</b> in comparison.	One of my friends with a crazy sense of fashion loves to wear a tophat and a scarf so that you can´t see his whole face but only his mouth. He thinks it´s cool. I think it´s pathetic.	A poor, homeless child like Oliver Twist, with a hungry open mouth, is pathetic-- in the original sense of the noun "pathos." The tattered tophat and scarf he wears only adds to the pathos.	<img src="哀.png">
遠	distant	distant, earthenware jar, lidded crock, soil, dirt, ground, mouth, scarf, road	If you see a <b>lidded crock</b> wrapped in a <b>scarf</b> while on the <b>road</b> - keep <b>distant</b>. It might be a bomb.	Keep distant from a lidded crock on the road wrapped in a scarf. It might be a bomb.

The MONKEY likes to play hide and seek with the PACK of WILD DOGS by hiding in the LIDDED CROCK. But he is easy to see because the SCARF he always wears is at the base of the LIDDED CROCK.	To catch a monkey, chase him with wild dogs into a lidded crock, then tie it with a scarf.	<img src="猿.png">
初	first time	first time, cloak, sword, dagger	He <b>cloak</b>ed his <b>dagger</b> with a Durex on the <b>first time</b>.	This is the first time we´ve been out of the Shire, Mr. Frodo! Says Sam, covering himself with his cloak and clutching his dagger.	On his FIRST TIME, he cloaked his dagger with a Trojan.	<img src="初.png">
布	linen	linen, by one’s side, towel	The <b>towel by your side</b> should always be <b>linen</b>.	A matador holding his red linen by his side.	The first rule of the Hitch-Hiker´s Guide to the Universe is "DON´T PANIC!" The second rule, of course, is to always have a towel by your side. Personally, I prefer the linen sort.	<img src="布.png">
幅	hanging scroll	hanging scroll, towel, wealth, one, ceiling, mouth, rice field, brains	The <b>towel</b> of a <b>wealthy</b> man is a priceless <b>hanging scroll</b>.	In the west, the rich use $100 bills to light their cigars...

市	market	market, top hat, towel	Buying a <b>top hat</b> and <b>towel</b> at the <b>market</b>.	My recurring nightmare: Walking through the market, and suddenly realizing that I´m wearing only a top hat...and a towel.	At the MARKET you find lots of nice TOP HATS and TOWELS.	<img src="市.png">

帯	sash	sash, buckle, apron, crown, towel	Buried under <b>Mt. Fuji</b>, the <b>crowned towel</b> is actually a sacred <b>sash</b>.	First, note that the top half of the kanji consists of one and mountain. Of course, the "number 1" mountain in Japan is Mt. Fuji. The bottom half, under Mt. Fuji, consists of crown and towel. Now for the story. Archaeologists digging under Mt. Fuji (Japan´s #1 mountain) in an ancient royal tomb (they know it´s royal because of the crown) discover what looks like a towel, but after they clean it up, they see it is actually a splendid royal sash for the king´s kimono.	Beautiful "Miss Housewife Japan" is on posters everywhere, cooking right before Mt. Fuji (the number one mountain) while wearing nothing but her crown, and an apron tied with a sash. (hodgepodge of mspertus, zwarte_kat, et al, with a jot of hadaka apron to focus the image.).	<img src="帯.png">
滞	stagnate	stagnate, water, water droplets, water pistol, sash, buckle, apron, crown, towel	If you get <b>water</b> on your <b>sash</b>, it will start to <b>stagnate</b>.	History of the first karate blackbelts: In those days, it was often difficult to find fresh, clean water, so samurai usually had to wash their sashes in stagnant puddles. The longer one had been studying martial arts, the older the sash on one´s karate uniform and, therefore, the darker the color. So why weren´t their karate uniforms black too? Never seen a ninja????	A moat is a stagnate ring of water like an obi (sash) of water tied around the castle.	<img src="滞.png">
刺	thorn	thorn, tree, wood, belt, sword, sabre, saber	If you tighten a <b>belt</b> around a <b>tree</b>, the <b>sabres</b> that fly out are actually its <b>thorns</b>.

制	system	system, cow, belt, sword, sabre, saber	All <b>cows</b> taken to <b>market</b> will be slaughtered (with a <b>sabre</b>) <b>system</b>atically.	The system for making leather belts involves slicing up a cow with a sword.	Why all the gore and violence? How about a samurai cow? He doesn´t have to be a violent samurai, either. He only wears the sword because he´s part of the bushi SYSTEM. Actually, he studies ikebana, shodo, and zen. Imagine him sitting cross-legged in a Zen temple (a very Special Zen temple).

The REVOLVING wheels of the car (with REVOLVER blaring on the stereo) kicked up RISING CLOUDS of dust.

The katakana-ization of this is {ニム}バス, so the rising cloud primative is just an abbreviation of that name written from top to bottom in the old Japanese style.	<img src="転.png">

橋	bridge	bridge, tree, wood, angel, heavens, mouth, hood, mouth, mouth2	You need <b>wood</b> and the assistance of an <b>angel</b> and a <b>hood</b>ed man, if you want to build a <b>bridge</b>.	The nicest bridge is not in Hollywood or Los Angeles, but in San Francisco.	A small 5 year old child has lost her mother in a tragic death. Her family tells her, "Don´t worry, your mom is an angel now, in heaven, watching over you." The small girl takes this very literally and is found one day, gathering pieces of wood. Her dad asks her, "What are you doing with that wood?" "I´m trying to build a bridge to heaven to visit the angels.".	<img src="橋.png">

帝	sovereign	sovereign, vase, stand up, apron, crown, towel	<b>Standing</b> in front of everyone in nothing but a <b>crown</b> and a <b>towel</b>. That's our <b>sovereign</b> for you.	The crazy sovereign stands up from his throne, wearing nothing but a crown and a towel. That´s why they try to keep him locked up in the castle away from the public.	This one is so tricky for me. The key is to remember that the bottom stroke on the standing element takes those little crown "winglets" on the right and left. The most effective image might be of QEII (who is quite short) using her crown as a kind of stool. She´s standing on her crown rummaging through a high cupboard looking for her apron. I guess the sovereign´s servants have the day off.	<img src="帝.png">

I use what I think is the real etymology for this kanji which is so shocking it sticks. The STANDING member at the top is a certain part of the body that all men have and it is approaching the HOLE between TWO LEGS (the HOOD) with extra marks to show they are FLESHY - ie a womans legs. So this shows the oldest DEAL of all time - prostitution.	Slick Willy standing on the motorcycle helmet he´s trying to sell you to demonstrate how rugged it is.

I hear that some plum-loving scientists are working on a way to hack every tree´s genetic code so that every tree will bear nothing _but_ plums.	EVERY Japanese person asks you if you like UMEBOSHI.

Imagine you´ve just arrived in Japan, but don´t have a cell phone yet, so instead you´re carrying around a portable turkey you can hold in your fist. To dial a number, just poke it with your fingers.	Because they have no fingers, turkeys must use their fists when dialing on a portable phone.	<img src="携.png">

丈	length	length, stick, tucked under the arm	A guy with outstretched arms and his willy dangling down, showing off the <b>length</b> of both.	Both a meter and a yard are about one arm-length.	This kanji reminds me of the kanji for big (I think it looks the same kinda of except for the last stroke). Maybe this works for guys, but when you were growing up you would compare "length" with your friends trying to show how BIG you were. You wouldn´t show "it" but you would spread your arms out as wide as possible to exaggerate your length. Maybe even so wide that you trip (I the 3rd stroke getting pushed over)! I just find it easier to relate this to the previous kanji.	<img src="丈.png">

After her boyfriend´s crotch has been satisfied, a woman might suggest they cuddle. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might say, "Or again, we could fool around . . . ".

Imagine kids all over the top of a mulberry tree, sitting astride limbs so that their weight is on their crotches.

This woman is angry because of the guys in the previous frame who pay more attention to her crotch than her heart. I prefer to decompose the kanji in three elements here because it is easier to read like a mnemonic.	WOMEN get very ANGRY over the thought that GUYS are more interested in her CROTCH than her HEART.	<img src="怒.png">
友	friend	friend, by one’s side, crotch		A good friend is always at your side. ---- I teach at a Japanese High School, and I often see chummy male students grabbing each other´s crotches in a joking manner. It´s still weird to me, but apparently reaching to your side and grabbing you neighbor´s crotch is a great way to express friendship.	Think of a sex friend (a fuck buddy if you will).

投	throw	throw, finger, fingers, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch	Your <b>fingers</b> wrapp around your <b>missile</b> and <b>throw</b> it.	Well, you usually use your fingers to throw objects used as missile weapons. Easy. By the way, for those of you looking for a less anachronistic image for the missile primitive as a modern rocket, try a slingshot. it´s a crotch (originally a tree branch) that sends missile projectiles flying into/like the wind. And for this present kanji, it is something you naturally use with your fingers...	If you use the primitive "semen" (flying in the wind from your crotch) instead of missile then all kanjis with this primitive will hilariously create a perfect story.	<img src="投.png">
没	drown / sink	drown, water, water droplets, water pistol, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch	The <b>water missile</b> (torpedo) hit the submarine and everyone <b>drowned</b>.	(Note: this kanji is more collapse/cave-in/sink (#1888) than humans drowning) A water missile? A torpedo! And when it hits it´s target? The ship collapses then sinks and everyone drowns!	The submarine´s hull was breached after being struck by a torpedo ("water missile"), causing the entire crew to drown.	<img src="没.png">
設	establishment	establishment, say, words, keitai, mouth, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch	You can use <b>words</b> or <b>missiles</b> to attack an <b>establishment</b>.	Establishment can be attacked by words or by missiles. Writers will use words, whereas militars will use missiles.	When you attack the establishment with words, it fights back with missiles.	<img src="設.png">
撃	attack	beat, tank, car, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch, hand	Either a <b>car</b> with <b>missiles</b> or just your <b>hands</b> to <b>attack</b> someone.	Your car has missles?! That beats mine, hands down.	Think 3 methods of attack all combined into 1 kanji: 1. Vehicle to transport troops 2. Once troops have disembarked they have their missiles 3. If they run out of missiles they resort to hand to hand combat to beat the enemy.	<img src="撃.png">
殻	husk	husk, samurai, superfluous, crown, wind, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch, wind2	A <b>samurai's husk</b> is <b>superfluous</b> against <b>missile</b> attacks.	Samurai´s husk/shell/armour is superflous to missile attacks 甲殻　卵殻　貝殻.	husk or shell. Japan´s recent history in a nutshell: first the samurai became superfluous and then the Americans started to throw missiles and bombs during WWII.	<img src="殻.png">
支	branch	branch, ten, needle, crotch	I've stuck my <b>branch</b> in <b>ten crotches</b> this month! New record!	Picture sliding down the branch of a tree (in this case a pine tree or any tree with needles) and getting a bunch of needles stuck in your crotch--ouch!!	A special branch of the military called the Needle Crotch Unit. Their only weapon is the needle embedded in their crotches, and they´re quite adept at using them.	<img src="支.png">
技	skill	skill, finger, fingers, branch, ten, needle, crotch	I can use my <b>finger</b> and my <b>branch</b> with equal <b>skill</b>.	(Adapted from darg_sama´s) Balancing a branch on your finger is the prototypical example of a skill that is nothing more than a skill (i.e., it is completely useless).	I think of a guy balancing a branch on his finger, which definitely takes some minimal amount of skill.	<img src="技.png">
枝	bough	bough, tree, wood, branch, ten, needle, crotch	A <b>tree's</b> primary <b>branch</b> is called the <b>bough</b>.<br><br>(but it also means 'branch' so go figure)	The tree´s primary branch is known as the bough.	Differentiate between BOUGH and branch (#711): ´branch´ is smaller, and can also refer to the branch of a store (支店), which has nothing to do with a tree. But a BOUGH is a main part of a tree, perhaps where the trunk splits into several large boughs, and so it logically utilizes the 木 radical.	<img src="枝.png">
肢	limb	limb, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, branch, ten, needle, crotch	<b>Flesh branches = limbs</b>.	The limbs that this kanji represents are parts of the body that are connected to the trunk, like the main branches to a tree (“arms and legs” is the second meaning of this kanji). In other words, limbs are "flesh branches".	Limbs are body parts that branch off.	<img src="肢.png">
怪	suspicious	suspicious, Freud, state of mind, spool, clod, toilet paper, crotch, soil, dirt, ground	<b>Genos soils his pants</b> and everyone at the hero association meeting is <b>suspicious</b> about the smell.	When you´re suspicious, your state of mind twists round and round like a spool of thread.	Imagine a loud farting sound on The Enterprise (sorry). Everyone looks around trying to find who did it. The one looking most suspicious is Data. His soiled crotch gives him away.	<img src="怪.png">
軽	lightly	lightly, car, spool, clod, toilet paper, crotch, soil, dirt, ground	One time, in my <b>car</b>, I <b>soiled my pants</b>, but it's only <b>lightly</b> stained the leather...	Fact: this kanji is used to denote a certain class of vehicles in Japan whose engines are under a certain size (less than 750cc I think) and are called light vehicles here. Imagine a so-called light vehicle or a light-truck with a load of spools driving down a road ever so lightly, careful not to let any of the spools roll out onto the street.	I want to tread lightly on the environment.... That´s why I CAR-SPOOL to work everyday.... I know, lame.	<img src="軽.png">
叔	uncle	uncle, above, small, little, crotch	That one <b>uncle</b> that's always towering <b>above</b> a <b>little</b> one's <b>crotch</b>.	Oh come on people - say what we´ve all been thinking: the uncle is that creepy guy towering above a little one´s crotch.	Four straight kanji here with 叔 in it, so let´s make one story: Your UNCLE was full of loneliness (#720) (寂), and he lived by himself. He was naturally graceful (#721) (淑) in the water, and you knew he was once on the Olympic synchronized swimming team). You knew that there was something different about him, but you joined his youth team and he watched over you carefully as coach (#719) (督). It was uncomfortable, though, how your uncle (#718) often touched you just a little above the crotch (叔) when coaching...	<img src="叔.png">
督	coach	coach, uncle, above, small, little, crotch, eye	Creepy <b>uncle</b> likes to <b>eye</b> the gymnastics team from below so he volunteers as <b>coach</b>.	Creepy uncle volunteers as gymnastics coach so he can eye the team from below.	Four straight kanji here with 叔 in it, so let´s make one story: Your UNCLE was full of loneliness (#720) (寂), and he lived by himself. He was naturally graceful (#721) (淑) in the water, and you knew he was once on the Olympic synchronized swimming team. You knew that there was something different about him, but you joined his youth team and he watched over you carefully as coach (#719) (督). It was uncomfortable, though, how your uncle (#718) often touched you just a little above the crotch (叔) when COACHing...	<img src="督.png">
寂	loneliness	loneliness, house, uncle, above, small, little, crotch	Alone in his <b>house</b>, the <b>uncle</b> is filled with <b>loneliness</b>.	The unmarried uncle´s house is the picture of lonlieness.	Four straight kanji here with 叔 in it, so let´s make one story: Your UNCLE was full of loneliness (#720) (寂), and he lived by himself. He was naturally graceful (#721) (淑) in the water, and you knew he was once on the Olympic synchronized swimming team. You knew that there was something different about him, but you joined his youth team and he watched over you carefully as coach (#719) (督). It was uncomfortable, though, how your uncle (#718) often touched you just a little above the crotch (叔) when coaching...	<img src="寂.png">
反	anti-	anti-, demonstation, cliff, crotch	Kick the enemy in the <b>crotch</b> and push them off a <b>cliff</b> - that's how <b>anti-</b>heroes do it.	I think of an anti-hero (Dirty Harry etc.) for this primitive, whose trademark for disposing of villians is not an honorable fight, but a kick in the crotch and then a shove off a cliff (perhaps whilst the villain´s back is turned).	Many cultures are so anti-sex you´d think they just want people to throw their crotches over a cliff.	<img src="反.png">
坂	slope	slope, soil, dirt, ground, anti-, demonstration, cliff, crotch	<b>Anti-ground</b> - a <b>slope</b>.	As the villain (pushed off by the anti-hero) is tumbling down the slope, he activates gadget skis to escape, spraying soil everywhere as he flies down the slope.	This kanji depicts a classic enviornmental problem: erosion. Erosion occurs when all of the soil washes of the side of the cliff, eventually causing the cliff to disappear, leaving a slope (an anti- cliff if you will) in its place.	<img src="坂.png">
板	plank	plank, tree, wood, anti-, demonstration, cliff, crotch	<b>Trees</b> are <b>anti-plank</b>, obviously.	Of course, trees are anti-plank. Wouldn´t you be if you were a tree?	Trees are naturally opposed to, or anti, the making of planks.	<img src="板.png">
返	return	return, anti-, demonstration, cliff, crotch, road	The forward-road for going forwards, and the <b>anti-road</b> for when you want to <b>return</b>.	Pretty obvious: to return is to turn back on the road you´re on and go the opposite way.	In "The Return of the anti-hero", Clint Eastwood kicks the villain in the crotch, pushes them off the cliff and onto a busy highway. A tiring movie franchise to say the least....	<img src="返.png">
販	marketing	marketing, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, anti-, demonstration, cliff, crotch	Some people are <b>anti-money</b> just because of all the <b>marketing</b> that goes on.	The goal of marketing is to get people who are naturally anti-buying to spend their shells (money).	『MARKETING: MONEY, ANTI』 The wide presence of MARKETING in our society has led people to become ANTI-MONEY.	<img src="販.png">
爪	claw	claw, vulture		A pictograph of Wolverine´s adamantium claws.	Pictograph, see book. * I prefer the primitive meaning of an eagle rather than vulture. Somehow vulture makes me think more about meat and dead corpses than claws. An eagle however immediately brings to my mind the image of an eagle plunging into a stream catching fish in his claws, or that of the great eagles rescuing Bilbo and his party in Jrr Tolkien´s novel “Bilbo the Hobbit”.	<img src="爪.png">
妥	gentle	gentle, claw, vulture, woman	The <b>eagle</b> picks up a <b>woman</b> very <b>gently</b>.	Overly gentle women are vultures who want to marry you and steal your money - not true but an easy mnemonic!	An eagle must be extra gentle to pick up a dainty woman in its sharp claws.	<img src="妥.png">
乳	milk	milk, fledgling, claw, vulture, child, fishhook	<b>Fledglings hooked</b> on <b>milk</b>.	A fledgling is being nursed at a zoo, it is fed milk through a small tube that is bent in the shape of a hook (so that it fits inside its beak). The fledgling soon becomes addicted to milk, giving us this very catchy mnemonic: “fledgling hooked on milk”.	Drinking milk not only reduces cavity (#96)´s but also strengthens nails (claws) thanks astgtciv.	<img src="乳.png">
浮	floating	floating, water, water droplets, water pistol, fledgling, claw, vulture, child	In the <b>water</b>, a <b>fledgling</b> will definitely <b>float</b>.	Floating rubber ducky!!!	A nest of fledglings somehow fell into the water (maybe it was perched on a tree bending over the river), but they are safe for now as the nest is floating. The fledglings are enjoying the cruise but they are soon coming to a great waterfall... ( a little drama to help us remember the story).	<img src="浮.png">
将	leader	leader, turtle, claw, vulture, glue	The <b>turtle</b> stuck the <b>eagle's</b> feet down with <b>glue</b>, so he is the clear <b>leader</b> in this race!	The leader in this race is the turtle! It appears he has covered the vulture’s feet in glue, so that the vulture cannot get off the starting block.	X-men and TMNT join forces: Their new leader is an awsome asshole. He is simply Wolverine and Raphael glued together back to back (the biggest assholes from both groups combined).	<img src="将.png">
奨	exhort	exhort, leader, turtle, claw, vulture, glue, large, St. Bernard	A <b>leader</b> using his <b>big</b> dog to <b>exhort</b> his underlings into working harder.	It´s easy to picture a LEADER that uses a BIG dog to EXHORT his people to do more.	Here we have a St.Bernard exhorting the vulture to become the leader in the race against the turtle, but he can´t because of the glue. see leader (#731).	<img src="奨.png">
採	pick	pick, finger, fingers, grab, claw, vulture, tree, wood	<b>Picking</b> cherries with your <b>fingers</b> when suddenly an <b>eagle</b> swoops down and takes away the whole <b>tree</b>.	You pick cheries with your fingers, then along comes a giant vulture and picks up the whole tree with its claws.	Tip: vulture + tree : Heisig later combines these into a single kanji 采 called grab (#2090). Story: As you go to pick your nose, your parent grabs your finger and pulls it away (& gives you a lecture on social etiquette). REF: "grab" also appears in vegetable (#734), coloring (#1714).	<img src="採.png">
菜	vegetable	vegetable, flowers, grab, claw, vulture, tree, wood	Sat under the <b>flowers</b> in a <b>tree</b>, the <b>eagle</b> waits for the <b>vegetables</b> to grow.	A vegetarian vulture is munching on a flower, perched on a tree, patiently waiting for a patch of vegetables to grow.	Wolverine is turning into total hippie. He said he only eats vegetables now and last time I saw him sitting in a tree with flowers in his hair.	<img src="菜.png">
受	accept	accept, birdhouse, birdcage, claw, vulture, crown, crotch	The <b>birdhouse</b> (brothel) will <b>accept</b> any <b>crotch</b>.	The bird house is the brothel (someone else said so) and of course everyone is welcome - thay accept any crotch.	A birdhouse is a whorehouse that will accept any crotch even those with STDs. (Image: a birdhouse whorehouse with every kind of bird coming and going. Some old madam at the front hole accepts everyone, even the nasty old crows).	<img src="受.png">
授	teaching	impart, finger, fingers, accept, birdhouse, birdcage, claw, vulture, crown, crotch	The teacher pointing with his <b>finger</b> and the student <b>accepting</b> everything the teacher is <b>teaching</b>.	Please accept this finger, you say, imparting it to your yakuza boss.	This character depicts a student and teacher. The teacher imparts his knowledge on the student, pointing the way and guiding with the finger. Meanwhile, the student sits there passively accepting the tutelage of his superior.	<img src="授.png">
愛	love	love, birdhouse, birdcage, claw, vulture, crown, love birds, heart, walking legs	About to enter the <b>brothel</b>, the man remembers his true love and, following his <b>heart</b>, uses his <b>walking legs</b> to go straight home.	If you really love someone, you won´t keep them in a cage-like bird house relationship, but rather open the door and let their heart walk around freely. Think less about "I" (あい) and more about "we".	The man is about to enter the ´birdhouse´ (brothel) when he remembers his true love at home, and, following his heart, uses his walking legs to go straight home.	<img src="愛.png">
払	pay	pay, finger, fingers, elbow	Walking out of a restaurant when the waiter wraps his <b>fingers</b> around your <b>arm</b> - "didn't you forget to <b>pay</b>..?" he asks.	You´re at a restaurant and raise your finger to indicate to the waiter that you want to pay. Your friend elbows you in the ribs -- it´s his shout, and he insists on taking care of the bill.	You are walking out of the restaurant when the waiter uses his FINGERS to grab you at the ELBOW and says, "excuse me sir, didn´t you forget to PAY?".	<img src="払.png">
広	wide	wide, cave, elbow	In the <b>cave</b>, Batman is always working out to make his <b>arms wide</b>.<br><br>(visualise it)	The Batcave is very wide and has a lot of elbow room for Batman to do his yoga.	A wide cave has a lot of "elbow room".	<img src="広.png">
拡	expansion	broaden, finger, fingers, wide, cave, elbow	<b>Finger</b> a girl until she is <b>wide</b> enough - this kind of <b>expansion</b> is required every time if you've got a big...	Japanese girls are tight and may require fingers inserted to broaden them and make them wide enough before you can...	Spread your fingers wide to broaden your hand.	<img src="拡.png">
弁	valve	valve, elbow, two hands	Use your <b>arm muscles</b> and <b>both hands</b> to undo a really stubborn <b>valve</b>.<br><br>(my friend べん is really good at this)	Opening a stuck valve requires 2 hands and a lot of elbow grease.	The cubans build a pipe to flood the USA. Castro just has to turn the valve on it, and USA is flooded. Suddenly, CIA agents tackle him from behind, grabbing both his arms. But Castro manages to open the valve with his elbow, by raising the elbow above his head. Success! USA is no more...	<img src="弁.png">
雄	masculine	masculine, Yamanote, by one’s side, elbow, turkey	Guys swinging their <b>arms by their sides</b>, walking like a <b>turkey</b>, think they look <b>masculine</b>.	Men walk with their elbows out from their sides in a weird turkey trot when they try to appear very MASCULINE. Think of a 70´s pimp walk.	Masculine duties are to offer your elbow to the lady by your left side and to cut the turkey on special meals.	<img src="雄.png">
台	pedestal	pedestal, elbow, mouth	Someone's <b>elbow</b> above your <b>mouth</b>. Unless you're short, he must be stood on a <b>pedestal</b>.	When someone´s elbow is above your mouth he/she is probably standing on a pedestal.	After training your whole life, you manage to get a bronze medal in the Olympics. You´re extremely proud of your accomplishment as you step up to receive your medal. The guy in first place is up on a pedestal, towering above you, his elbow level with your mouth. Being a smug bastard, he "accidentally" knocks his elbow into your mouth, causing you to bleed and lose a tooth. Just cause he won the gold doesn´t mean he can place himself on such a high pedestal and do whatever he wants!	<img src="台.png">
怠	neglect	neglect, pedestal, elbow, mouth, heart	The <b>heart</b> is under the <b>pedestal</b>, not on it. Clearly it has been <b>neglected</b>.	While standing on the pedestal at the award ceremony, the recipient heartlessly neglected to mention the people that got him there.	Someone you put on a pedestal will NEGLECT your heart.	<img src="怠.png">
治	fix	reign, water, water droplets, water pistol, pedestal, elbow, mouth	<b>Water</b> damaged the <b>pedestal</b> so you need to <b>fix</b> it.	From his water pedestal Neptune reigns over his Sea Empire.	Build a moat around your pedestal to protect your reign of power.	<img src="治.png">
始	commence	commence, woman, pedestal, elbow, mouth	The <b>woman</b> stood at the <b>pedestal</b> will now <b>commence</b> the ceremony.	Many men, before they commence their relationship with the woman of their desires, place her on something of a pedestal, which often leads to disappointment later on.	If you want to commence a relationship, just put a woman on a pedestal and she´ll love ya forever.	<img src="始.png">
胎	womb	womb, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, pedestal, elbow, mouth	<b>Flesh pedestal = womb</b>	The body part feminists like to put on a pedestal is the womb, especially when they hear a man complain about some responsibility. "We give birth, so it´s your duty to do so-and-so".	If any body part deserves to be put on a pedestal, it is the womb from which new life springs forth.	<img src="胎.png">
窓	window	window, hole, house, human legs, elbow, heart	Looking into a <b>house</b> you see <b>legs</b> dangling from the ceiling and <b>arms</b> and <b>hearts</b> scattered on the floor. That will teach you not to look through murderer's <b>windows</b>.	This is either a love scene or a murder scene that you are seeing through a window. The love scene: through the window of a house (from a distance), you see a pair of human legs, then elbows, and then some pink hearts floating up like in a cartoon. The murder scene: peering through the window of a house, you see a gruesome murder scene. Human legs dangling from a ceiling fan, an elbow sticking out of a wall, and a heart still beating on the carpet.	A photographer is at home, recovering his broken human legs. With nothing better to do, he is looking through the rear window with his camera (he needs to use his elbow to support those heavy lenses) until his heart begins to race as he witnesses a murder!	<img src="窓.png">
去	gone	gone, soil, dirt, ground, elbow	The <b>soil</b> stains, if you use your <b>arm muscles</b>, will soon be <b>gone</b>.	Going, going, GONE!, said the gravedigger as he shoveled soil onto the body´s protruding elbow (the last bit left to cover).	If you want the soil stains gone from your clothes, then you´ll need to put some elbow grease into cleaning them.	<img src="去.png">
法	method	method, water, water droplets, water pistol, gone, soil, dirt, ground, elbow	Leave something in <b>water</b> until it is <b>gone</b>. It's a good <b>method</b> for getting rid of bodies.	This kanji shows up in a lot of words related to the legal process. Try this image: using a very outdated judicial method, the people of Salem dunked accused witches in the water until they were all gone.	There already was a system (#418) for butchering cows, a technique (#421) for turning smoke into flowers - why can´t there be a method of about the same relevance for making water gone? Evaporation anyone?	<img src="法.png">
会	meeting	meeting, meeting, one, wall, umbrella, rising cloud, two, elbow, wall	Under a <b>roof</b> and between <b>walls</b> (or 'inside') is the best place for <b>meeting</b> someone.	At the local company they have a very gory way of getting rid of incompetent personnel : they arrange a business meeting in a very special room where the walls are ... meeting. Not surprisingly the boss is never present at these meetings, he´s the one who pushes the button that sets the walls in motion.	The only thing created in most meetings is a lot of hot air. Imagine a cloud of it rising to the roof.	<img src="会.png">
至	climax	climax, wall, one, ceiling, elbow, soil, dirt, ground	Against a <b>wall</b> or even on the <b>floor</b> - I can <b>climax</b> anywhere.	Sexual climaxes don´t always happen on the bed; they sometimes happen against a wall or on the ground!	The climax of the Berlin Wall affair was the tearing of it to ground.	<img src="至.png">
室	room	room, house, climax, wall, one, ceiling, elbow, soil, dirt, ground	In your <b>house</b>, you should probably only <b>climax</b> in your own <b>room</b>.	You book a room in a love hotel called "Climax House".	A simple room is made up of a roof, some walls, and a dirt floor.	<img src="室.png">
到	arrival	arrival, climax, wall, one, ceiling, elbow, soil, dirt, ground, sword, sabre, saber	Just as we were about to <b>climax</b>, her father <b>arrived</b> holding a <b>sword</b>.

致	doth	doth, climax, wall, one, ceiling, elbow, soil, dirt, ground, taskmaster	To reach the <b>climax</b> of the dominatrix <b>taskmaster</b>, you must <b>doth</b> her bidding.<br /><br />(???)	To reach climax I doth the bidding of my dominatrix taskmaster.	This character is used in two very high-frequency words: "you are welcome" (どう致しまして) and the honorific form of onegaishimasu (お願い致します; おねがいいたします). Can´t you just picture this ridiculously polite S&M picture? A businessman, who DOTH the bidding of his taskmistress, is climaxing and yelling out "お願い致します" while she whips and says "どう致しまして". (This kanji also means "to bring about" and "do humbly", which is perfect for this image).	<img src="致.png">
互	mutually	mutually, one, ceiling, one, floor		The 69 position allows both parties to mutually give themselves pleasure.	If you can combined your walls with another house´s walls, both houses would mutually benefit, by the increase in size....	<img src="互.png">
棄	abandon	abandon, infant, toddler, top hat, elbow, buckle, tree, wood	An <b>infant</b> was taken up <b>Mt.Fuji</b> and left atop a <b>tree</b> - <b>abandoned</b> by his parents.	Think of a really loud and annoying baby, you want to abandon it but it keeps coming back...so you take of your belt by the buckle, and buckle the baby to a tree!	As in sash (#415), I treat the one mountain in the middle to mean Mt. Fuji (Japan´s ichiban mountain). Now we see an infant being abandoned on top of Mt. Fuji well above the tree line to die of exposure.	<img src="棄.png">
育	bring up	bring up, infant, toddler, top hat, elbow, moon, month, flesh, part of the body	<b>Bring up</b> the <b>infant</b> well until it is big enough to harvest the <b>flesh</b>.	Bringing up your offspring means raising them from infant until they are meat ready to be harvested. What, cannibalism is in poor taste? Forget I ever brought it up. But bring up will forver be infant meat to me. I want my baby back baby back baby back ribs!	I will bring up my infants to eat meat. I´ll not endure any vegetarian children in my house!	<img src="育.png">
撤	remove	remove, finger, fingers, borstal, bring up, infant, toddler, top hat, elbow, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, taskmaster	What heppens to the <b>finger</b> of an infant <b>brought up</b> by a horrible yakuza <b>taskmaster</b> if he does something wrong? It is <b>removed</b>.	A terrible yakuza taskmaster is bringing up his infant. Every time the infant does something wrong... well, you know what happens to yakuzas when they do something wrong.

充	allot	allot, infant, toddler, top hat, elbow, human legs	In China, to prevent too many <b>infant</b> <b>legs</b> walking around, everyone is <b>allotted</b> only one child.	Scene at the baby factory: Manager: "Good news! Your infant has been allotted human legs". Parent to be: "Thanks a lot!".	In China, to prevent too many human legs walking around, couples are alloted only one infant…　RTK2:　ジュウ　補充　ほじゅう(supplement)…　Semi-Pure Group:　銃762　(ﾄｳ): 統1347.	<img src="充.png">
銃	gun	gun, metal, gold, allot, infant, toddler, top hat, elbow, human legs	The <b>metal</b> thing <b>allotted</b> to everyone in the USA is a <b>gun</b>.	Everyone is allotted a metal gun (US constitution according to the NRA).	What is a gun but a device for allotting pieces of metal? One for you - BANG!...One for you - BANG!...One for you - BANG!...One for you - BANG!...etc.	<img src="銃.png">
流	current	current, water, water droplets, water pistol, lifebelt, infant, toddler, top hat, elbow, stream, flood	<b>Infant</b> Moses placed in the<b> water</b> by the <b>stream</b>, but the <b>current</b> took him far away.	INFANT Moses placed in the WATER and sent down the current of the STREAM.	A water-breathing infant (genetically modified?) is caught in a flood, and drifts with the current, apparently enjoying himself in the process.	<img src="流.png">
唆	tempt	tempt, mouth, streetwalker, Ministry of silly walks, John Cleese, license, elbow, human legs, walking legs	Prostitutes in Amsterdam need a <b>mouth</b>, a <b>licence</b> and sexy <b>walking legs</b> in order to <b>tempt</b> any customers.	I named the right part legal prostitute has it represents a walker [walking legs] with the license. It´s easy to imagine a legal prostitute tempting a man with her mouth.	Prostitutes in Amsterdam have a license to show off their walking legs and tempt customers with their mouths.	<img src="唆.png">
出	exit	exit		Suddenly, a cactus comes out of the ground with a sign that reads: exit. Now you can leave the desert! (Note: giving this primitive the meaning ´cactus´ can be useful later).	The exit lays between these two mountains.	<img src="出.png">
山	mountain	mountain		Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive this element appears equally as well at the top or bottom of the kanjis (besides appearing to the left). Since a mountain often brings to mind towering peaks, I will consider it implied that the element is placed at the top of the kanji. When this primitive appears at the bottom, I will arrange my story in a way that other elements are said to be at the very top of the mountain (see FRAME 775 for an example).	YOU CAN´T POSSIBLY NEED A MNEMONIC FOR THIS!!!!	<img src="山.png">
岩	boulder	boulder, mountain, stone, rock	A <b>mountain</b>-sized <b>stone</b> is a <b>boulder</b>.	A mountain-sized stone is known as a boulder.	Here we see mountain rocks rolling down the mountain, gathering into a single monstrous boulder crushing everything in its path. Think snowball effect, even if it wouldn´t work with rocks.	<img src="岩.png">
炭	charcoal	charcoal, mountain, ashes, cliff, fire	Under the <b>mountain</b>, the <b>ash</b>-coloured stones are all <b>charcoal</b>.	Burn enough charcoal and you´ll have a mountain of ash.	You get charcoal from volcano ("fire mountain", 火山) ashes.	<img src="炭.png">
岐	branch off	branch off, mountain, branch, ten, needle, crotch	Take the road around the <b>mountain</b> - it <b>branches off</b> to the right.	On the left, there are three mountains. The road branches off to each of them. (Note: This kanji is mostly used for branches in the road).	In a lot of Super Nintendo-era RPGs, there are mountain levels to get through. You view them from overhead, so you can see a mazelike path with many branches. Picture your sprite characters at one such fork in the mountain path, as it branches off in two directions.	<img src="岐.png">
峠	mountain pass	mountain peak, mountain, above, below	Arriving at the <b>mountain</b>, you must decide whether to take the <b>up mountain pass</b> or the <b>down mountain pass</b>.	Heisig mentions at kanjiclinic.com that he wishes he´d chosen mountain pass for this keyword as it´s closer to what the word means. If we do this, the kanji makes complete sense because a mountain pass is just below the mountain top.	To the north of Lorien lies the Misty Mountains, and below their towering peaks are the Mines of Moria. The Fellowship of the Ring first tried for the MOUNTAIN PASS that goes above, but were halted by the wizardry of Saruman at Caradhras, and so are forced to take the MOUNTAIN PASS that goes below, through the mountain - a path long feared by Gandalf for the ancient evil that lurks there. Note : the kanji does in fact refer to a "mountain pass".	<img src="峠.png">
崩	crumble	crumble, mountain, companion, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, moon2, month2, flesh2, part of the body2	The <b>mountain</b> crushed the two <b>companions</b> below (Frodo &amp; Sam?) as it <b>crumbled</b>.	Sam and Frodo were steadfast companions even as Mount Doom crumbled above them.	September 11. [lol it also has 11 strokes], whoever reported this story is a loser, get alife. This is the best story on the website.	<img src="崩.png">
密	secrecy	secrecy, house, invariably, heart, mountain	Secret society <b>houses need</b> to be in the <b>mountains</b> to maintain <b>secrecy</b>.	To maintain secrecy, secret societies invariably have to house themselves in the moutains.	To maintain secrecy, secret societies invariably have to house themselves on top of the moutains. (Slight tweak of chamcham´s story, using fuaburisa´s idea for remembering where to put the mountain primitive.).	<img src="密.png">
蜜	honey	honey, house, invariably, heart, insect	Your <b>house</b> will <b>inevitably</b> attract <b>insects</b> if you have <b>honey</b>.	When I think of honey, I think of a bee hive, which is a HOUSE that INVARIABLY has INSECTS.	A house with a lot of honey will invariably attract many insects.	<img src="蜜.png">
嵐	storm	storm, mountain, wind, gnats, drop, insect	The <b>mountain</b> has been flung in the air by the <b>wind</b> - that's how bad the <b>storm</b> is.	Storm is a full-blown wind that rips the mountains off the ground (you see one flying here).	Winds are gathering at the base of the mountain (note the hint to primitive placement), going up, and turning into a huge mountain storm.	<img src="嵐.png">
崎<div>[ 碕-埼-崎 ]</div>	promontory [?-?-?]	promontory, mountain, strange, large, St. Bernard, can, street, nail, spike, mouth	The <b>mountain</b> that looks <b>strange</b> is actually just a <b>promontory</b>, jutting off into the sea.<div><br /></div><div>(The three kanjis 碕, 埼 and 崎 all have the same meanings and pronunciations. They have very little uses other than names, for which promontory is the clear winner with over 2300 uses in place and people names, while the other two kanjis account for less than 200 names.)</div>	This is “Cape Strange” from FRAME 153, only with mountain in place of soil. Interestingly, there is also 碕 which is made of the primitives stone and strange. The three kanjis 碕, 埼 and 崎 all have the same meanings and pronunciations. They have very little uses other than names, for which promontory is the clear winner with over 2300 uses in place and people names, while the other two kanjis account for less than 200 names.	A promontory is a small, strange mountain that juts out into the sea.	<img src="崎.png">
入	enter	enter		Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive, using the image of going through a door, even one that stands alone with the frame and no wall around, helps flesh out the primitive “enter”.	Person enters stage left…　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　ニュウ　入院　にゅういん(admittance into a hospital).	<img src="入.png">
込	crowded	crowded, enter, road	Trying to <b>enter</b> the <b>road</b> from a junction is impossible when it is <b>crowded</b>.	During a traffic jam it is impossible to get your car to enter the roadway as it is crowded with cars. Think of a grid lock so bad cars are litterally scraping up against each other like people on a Japanese train during rush hour.	Everybody tries to enter the road during rush hour. That´s why it´s so crowded.	<img src="込.png">
分	part	part, eight, sword, dagger	<b>Part, understand, minute</b>	When something is entered by a dagger, it ends up being cut in several parts.	(This kanji also has the meanings of "understand" and "minute"). It´s important to understand that were you to enter an hour with a dagger and cut it into parts, those parts would be minutes.	<img src="分.png">
貧	poverty	poverty, part, eight, sword, dagger, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	Only <b>part</b> of the <b>problem</b> is money, when talking about <b>poverty</b>.	In the case of true poverty, not having money is only part of the problem. There are other components as well, like lack of education, class structuring, etc., but that doesn´t really matter. Just remember that the money is only part of it, not the whole.	Parting with your money will lead to poverty.	<img src="貧.png">
公	public	public, eight, elbow	I always <b>enter</b>&nbsp;<b>public</b> restrooms with my <b>elbows</b> because I don´t want to touch the door with my hands.	I always open the doors to the public restrooms with my elbows because I don´t want to touch the door with my hands.	I always enter the doors to the public restrooms with my elbows because I don´t want to touch the door with my hands.	<img src="公.png">
松	pine tree	pine tree, tree, wood, public, eight, elbows	Most <b>trees</b> you see in <b>public</b> are <b>pine trees</b>.	Following up with the "entering public restrooms" story for the right-hand primitive: public restrooms always reek of pine tree scented disinfectant.	A pine tree is a public tree: they are frequently planted in public squares, in commemoration of the respect Conficius held for them.	<img src="松.png">
訟	sue	sue, say, words, keitai, mouth, public, eight, elbows	Take care what you <b>say</b> in <b>public</b> lest you be <b>sued</b>.	Take care what words you say in public lest you be sued.	[+radical_tyro] Socrates was giving a speech in public. Things were going rather well, until his robe opened a bit and people saw his, well, not-public area. He was promptly sued for public indecency. Certain things shouldn´t be made public in public, you know?	<img src="訟.png">
谷	valley	valley, eight, umbrella, mouth	The <b>mouth</b> of the <b>valley</b> as Nausicaä flies down it on her glider.	This could be seen as a very accurate pictograph of another type of valley: a valley mouth open under the umbrella of inner labia, with the outer labia parted above. There are even more connections to be made among the primitive keywords and the visuals, but i will enter no further...	Think of the classic anime 風の谷のナウシカ (Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind). We see Nausicaa entering the valley mouth gliding on an umbrella.	<img src="谷.png">
浴	bathe	bathe, water, water droplets, water pistol, valley, eight, umbrella, mouth	The <b>water</b>&nbsp;in the <b>valley</b> is the perfect place to <b>bathe</b>.	This story is quite lascivious, sorry... Now, imagine you are at a 混浴　（こんよく） [two kanjis we now know] Onsen (温泉), and you are watching a woman bathe. Just picture the water dripping down her cleavage (that valley in between her breasts). Note: cleavage in Japanese is 谷間.	The mountain man uses the water from the valley to bathe.	<img src="浴.png">
容	🔺 contain 🔺	contain, house, valley, eight, umbrella, mouth	A <b>house</b> <b>countaining</b> an entire <b>valley</b>.	Imagine a house big enough to contain an entire valley. might want to live there. And now imagine cleaning it. . . . Maybe not . . .	Biodome.	<img src="容.png">
溶	melt	melt, water, water droplets, water pistol, contents, contain, house, valley, animal legs, eight, umbrella, mouth	The <b>water</b> the ice cube <b>contains</b> will all be gone when it <b>melts</b>.	As the mountain snow melts, there'll be WATER on the HOUSES in the VALLEY.	[melt; dissolve; thaw] An ice cube is melting, losing the water it contained.	<img src="溶.png">
欲	longing	longing, valley, eight, umbrella, mouth, lack, yawn	If a woman's <b>valley</b> is what you're <b>lacking</b>, you'll definitely be <b>longing</b> for one soon...	Guess what? Japanese has dirty words too! (In fact, a lot of them) A sexual story is NOT inappropriate here, as this kanji is very sexual, such as in 性欲; lust. As for a story: the lack of contact with a woman´s valley will leave a man LONGING for love.	The valley has something my life is lacking.... something I´ve been longing for.. peace and quiet.	<img src="欲.png">
裕	abundant	abundant, cloak, valley, eight, umbrella, mouth	Welcome to cloak-valley, the valley where everyone wears cloaks and every shop sells cloaks. Mnemonic : “<b>cloaks</b> are <b>abundant</b> in the <b>valley</b>”.	Again using the fact that cleavage in Japanese is called "valley of the chest": a woman with abundant cleavage tightly wraps up her bosom in a form-fitting cloak, but leaving her valley exposed. Another unforgettable image (thank you, thank you, I´ll be here all week).	Welcome to cloak-valley, the valley where everyone wears cloaks and every shop sells cloaks. Mnemonic : “cloaks are abundant in the valley”.	<img src="裕.png">
鉛	lead (metal)	lead, metal, gold, gully, eight, mouth	<b>Metal</b> flowing down a <b>gully</b> to be moulded into <b>lead</b> pencils.	Picture the molten lead (the heavy metal) being discreetly drained out of the factory into a gully behind.	Lead -> Dental fillings -> Metal that enters the mouth to fill a hole in a tooth.	<img src="鉛.png">
沿	run alongside	run alongside, water, water droplets, water pistol, gully, eight, mouth	<b>Water</b> in a <b>gully runs alongside</b> the path.	Water in a gully runs alongside the path.	Picture one of those idiots that run alongside the bicyclists in the Tour de France trying to give them water. Watch as the cyclist shoves the person into a gully that runs alongside the road.	<img src="沿.png">
賞	prize	prize, outhouse, small, little, crown, mouth, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	For being the 1000th person to use the restaurant´s <b>outhouse</b> today, you get 1000 <b>shellfish</b> as your <b>prize</b>.	Eat a shit shellfish dinner and win an evening in our restaurant's luxury outhouse. You'll be pissing out your arsehole for days.	As a prize for being the 1,000,000th person to use the restaurant´s outhouse, I got all the clams I could eat.	<img src="賞.png">
党	political party	party, outhouse, small, little, crown, mouth, human legs	A <b>toilet</b> on <b>legs</b> = <b>political party</b> (because they're all full of shit)	Every major political party, if personified, would look like a giant outhouse walking around with human legs spewing out a constant stream of bullshit.	Every political party is full of shit. But nobody ever says how they get that way. Well, here´s your answer - a political party memer is in the outhouse, greedily chowing down on the contents inside. He´s grown so accustomed to the taste that he´s in all the way, and all you can see are his legs through the window. He´ll come inside later to the auditorium to make a speech and spew everything out.	<img src="党.png">
堂	public chamber	public chamber, outhouse, small, little, crown, mouth, soil, dirt, ground	There's a <b>toilet</b> on the <b>ground</b> floor of every<b> public chamber</b>.	In most communities you will be hauled into city hall if you use the ground as an outhouse.	There is a secret hall buried in the soil underneath the outhouse.	<img src="堂.png">
常	usual	usual, outhouse, small, little, crown, mouth, towel	In some countries they don't have paper in the <b>toilets</b> - using one's own <b>towel</b> is the <b>usual</b> thing to do.	It´s usual to take your towel with your when you go to the outhouse at the onsen (hot springs bath in Japan) so everybody doesn´t see your stuff.	In the outhouse toilet you´d usually hope to find toilet paper to wipe your ass. If it´s already gone, which is usually the case, simply use the towel.	<img src="常.png">
掌	manipulate	manipulate, outhouse, small, little, crown, mouth, hand	In an <b>outhouse</b>, using your <b>hand</b> to '<b>manipulate</b>' yourself.	If you´re going to manipulate your body with your hand, then go do it in an outhouse, at least!	Instead of magazines, we keep a Rubiks Cube in the outhouse to manipulate with your hands while you do your business.	<img src="掌.png">
皮	pelt	pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook		A pelt is hooked on a branch. A small tent is made with a pelt and a branch planted in the ground. The mnemonic hints at the first stroke (the hanging pelt) and the hook at the end of the second stroke. This is chinese radical #107 meaning “skin”.	To be honest, this is one of those cases where I have found it easier to "just remember it" as a radical, as it occurs so frequently: 彼（かれ him）波（なみ wave）and so on.	<img src="皮.png">
波	waves	waves, water, water droplets, water pistol, pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook	The <b>watery pelt</b> (skin) of the ocean is the <b>waves</b>.	Waves are the ocean´s pelt (skin).	The Inuit used water-proof seal pelts for their kayaks, to travel the waves.	<img src="波.png">
婆	old woman	old woman, wave, water, water droplets, water pistol, pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook, woman	Standing on a cliff watching the <b>waves</b>, the <b>girl</b> slowly realises she has become an <b>old woman</b>.	An old woman is seen here as a woman with waves (i.e. wrinkles, creases).	You know "The Old Man and the Sea." Well, this is the sequel, "The Old Woman and the Sea Waves.".	<img src="婆.png">
披	expose	expose, finger, fingers, pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook	You <b>finger</b> your way through her <b>pelt</b> until you <b>expose</b> the glories within.<br><br><br>...ewww	You expose holes in a pelt by passing your fingers through them and wiggling them on the other side. The sense of the kanji here is to reveal something that was hidden, to make known, to open your heart (thus revealing it, exposing it to others), express your opinion, etc.	Think of it in this vulgar way. You really want her to expose her “beaver” pelt, so you have to encourage her with your fingers to expose it.	<img src="披.png">
破	rend	rend, stone, rock, pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook	Use a sharp <b>stone</b> on the <b>pelt</b> to <b>rend</b> it.	Before the invention of scissors or knives, sharp STONES were used to REND PELTs, so that caveman designers could complete new styles for the upcoming year.	Rend is a violent, primitive kind of word. (Image: cavemen rending pelts right off live animals with stone tools).	<img src="破.png">
被	incur	incur, cloak, pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook	A <b>cloak</b> made of<b> pelt</b> will <b>incur</b> the wrath of animal rights extremists.	If you wear a coat of fur (pelt) you are sure to incur the wrath of animal rights extremists.	A cloak of fur (pelt) will incur the wrath of animal lovers.	<img src="被.png">
残	remainder	remainder, bones, one, ceiling, evening, float	The <b>bones</b> <b>floating</b> near the shipwreck were the only <b>remainder</b> of the crew.	The remainder of the bones have been thrown from the float (for the dogs maybe, at the end of the parade).	Throwing all those coins (see coin (#368)) was a really bad idea; people got mad with greed. The only remainders left were the bones of those that was on the float.	<img src="残.png">
殊	particularly	particularly, bones, one, ceiling, evening, vermilion, drop, not yet, one, tree, wood	A T-<b>bone</b> steak is <b>vermilion</b>, <b>particularly</b> if served rare.	A t-bone steak is vermilion - particularly if served rare.	Castlevania -- The vermillion skeletons (bones) are particularly hard because they just keep regenerating.	<img src="殊.png">
殖	increase	augment, bones, one, ceiling, evening, straightaway, ten, needle, eye, fishhook	When I see a pretty lady, my <b>bone</b> will <b>straightaway</b> <b>increase</b> in size	Advertisement for Breast Implants -- Tired of nights all alone? Want to get boned straightaway? AUGMENT your breasts and all your troubles will be solved!	In the movie “Gattaca”, Vincent Freeman (played by Ethan Hawke) augments his size by straightening his bones (his legs), in order to match up with the genetically “perfect” population, and reach his goal of travelling in space. The stretching of his lower leg bones involved multiplying the bone cells, another sense of this key word.	<img src="殖.png">
列	file	file, bones, one, ceiling, evening, sword, sabre, saber	An army of skeletal (<b>bone</b>) soldiers holding <b>sabers</b>, standing in <b>file</b>.	A line of skeletal warriors, all armed with sabers.	Skeleton army rank and file. Dudes made of bones carrying sabres.	<img src="列.png">
裂	split	split, file, bones, one, ceiling, evening, sword, sabre, saber, cloth, clothes, clothing, garment	The <b>skeleton warriors</b>' <b>cloaks</b> kept getting <b>split</b> by their sharp bones.	They tried issuing the skeleton warriors with proper garments to wear, but they kept getting split by the sharp bones or by their sabres. In the end, it was decided they look scarier naked anyway.	Someone takes a sword made of bone to split the garment right down the middle. Very effective.	<img src="裂.png">
烈	ardent	ardent, file, bones, one, ceiling, evening, sword, sabre, saber, oven-fire, barbecue	<b>Skeleton warriors</b> marching through <b>fire</b> to prove how <b>ardent</b> they are.	The nazis were ardent believers in the master arian race, see them marching everyone else into the oven fires, single file.	The undead, marching single file, prove how ardent they are be walking across a field of flame. Fun fact, ardent used to mean to burn.	<img src="烈.png">
死	death	death, bones, one, ceiling, evening, spoon, sitting on the ground	Bone spoon	Ok, this is where knowing some Eastern culture comes in handy! In Japanese society, when someone dies they creamate the body and pick out the remaining bones with special chopsticks. In this case, they´re out of chopsticks so they decide to use (gasp!) a spoon instead.	Imagine the grim reaper (the bringer of death), carrying a spoon made of human bones instead of a scythe.	<img src="死.png">
葬	funeral	interment, flowers, death, bones, one, ceiling, evening, spoon, sitting on the ground, two hands	<b>Flowers</b> in the <b>dead</b> person's <b>two hands</b> as they lay in the open casket at their <b>funeral</b>.	I imagine an interment as a funeral. At this funeral it´s an open casket, and the dead body (death) is holding flowers with both of its hands.	During the interment ceremony, the grandchildren placed flowers over the dead body while the widow sat praying with two hands.	<img src="葬.png">
瞬	🔺 wink 🔺	wink, eye, Rose of Sharon, birdhouse, birdcage, claw, vulture, crown, sunglasses, dancing legs, ballerina, evening	You <b>eye</b> the ladies outside the <b>brothel</b> from a distance, wearing <b>sunglasses</b>. Suddenly you realise why they have been ignoring your <b>winks</b>...	Imagine Snoopy winking with his big eyes (and a happy smile) standing next to Woodstocks Birdhouse, woodstock being so cool that he wears little sunglasses.	What a dilemna, you wore SUNGLASSES over your EYES when you went to the BIRDHOUSE so you wouldn´t be recognized - but now you can´t WINK at the girl you want!	<img src="瞬.png">
耳	ear	ear		Your ear is like the eye on the side of your head for seeing things, but there is hair around it that creates jagged lines.	Pictograph, see book. * The primitive meaning can easily be extended to ear plugs.	<img src="耳.png">
取	take	take, ear, crotch	A magician who <b>takes</b> coins not only out of mens'&nbsp;<b>ears</b>, but also out of ladies' <b>crotches</b>!	You put your ear next to a womans crotch...and somehow, from it, you hear the words "Take me....".	Fuaburisu´s with a twist: You know that classic trick where someone pretends to take something out of an someone else´s ear (such as a coin). Instead of a cigarette or a pen he pulls the person’s crotch out of their ear. Very painful!	<img src="取.png">
趣	gist	gist, run, soil, dirt, ground, mend, take, ear, crotch	<b>Saitama</b> will <b>take</b> the <b>gist</b> of what you're saying but ignore most of it.<div><br /></div><div><b>趣</b>味でヒーローをやっているものだ (I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun)</div><div>趣味 - hobby</div>	The gist of it is this: We take the money and run!	A gist is a brief, quick understanding. A RUNning TAKE, if you will.	<img src="趣.png">
最	utmost	utmost, sun, day, take, ear, crotch	Seize (<b>take</b>) the <b>day</b> - do your <b>utmost</b>.	TAKE the UTMOST care when you SUN bath all DAY, or you´ll get burned from your EARS to your CROTCH.	Do your utmost - seize(take) the day.	<img src="最.png">
撮	snapshot	snapshot, finger, fingers, utmost, sun, day, take, ear, crotch	Your <b>finger</b> must take <b>utmost</b> care when taking a <b>snapshot</b>.	Take the utmost care that you don´t have your finger in the way when you take a snapshot.	When I learned photography from my dad as a little girl, he explained the basics to me: "when you take a snapshot, be careful not to put your fingers before the lens, and don´t look towards the sun (this was in the days that photographs would be spoiled by direct sunlight).	<img src="撮.png">
恥	embarrassed	shame, ear, heart	Putting your <b>ear </b>to a woman's chest to listen to her <b>heart</b>, but accidentally getting a boner. How <b>embarrassed</b> you must feel!	"Well, Sir. I've had my EAR to your HEART for a while now and not a single beat! You're clinically dead, I'm afraid."<br><br>"SHAME."	Vincent Van Gogh´s greatest shame was cutting off his ear to win the heart of a woman.	<img src="恥.png">
職	post (occupation)	post, ear, kazoo, sound, vase, stand up, sun, day, fiesta	The <b>ears</b> of the <b>racist sun-defenders</b> must be burning - not because of the sun, but because everyone talks behind their backs about how awful their <b>occupations</b> are!<br /><br /><i>shrugs shoulders</i>	Worst post in history: quality checker at the kazoo factory. Imagine the toll on your ears!	Buckingham Palace guards are famous for staying at their post no matter what, even if you blow a kazoo in their ear!	<img src="職.png">
聖	holy	holy, ear, mouth, king, jewel, ball	Point your <b>ear</b> to the <b>mouth</b> of the <b>king</b> - his words are <b>holy</b>.	The trick for me is to remember that the 耳 is to the left of the 口. However, this is easy because a true holy man uses his ear to listen (i.e., to God or his supplicant) before he opens his mouth to speak, unlike a charlatan who just makes something up. Of course, kings are often true holy men and prophets (e.g., King David in the bible).	A holy man hears with his ears before he speaks with his mouth, which places him higher than a king in people´s esteem.	<img src="聖.png">
敢	daring	daring, street, nail, spike, ear, taskmaster	A <b>nail</b> through the <b>ear</b> of the <b>taskmaster</b> - his fashion choices are so <b>daring</b>!	Only a truly daring Japanese student would wear a spike in his ear under the gaze of the Japanese teacher taskmasters!	See that ear nailed over there ? It´s the ear of the last person who was too daring with the taskmistress.	<img src="敢.png">
聴	listen	listen, ear, stethoscope, camel, ten, needle, eye, cross-eyed, net, heart	Your <b>ear</b> to <b>Darth Vader's heart</b> to <b>listen</b> to his heartbeat, but all you hear is beeps and boops.	I promise to use my ear to do nothing but listen ... stick a needle in my eye, cross my heart and hope to die! (Intentionally said backwards to get the order of the primitives correct).	Listening to others is different from hearing [1626] with the ear. One must allow the words to pierce through the eyes (the window of the soul) and reach deep into the heart...a symbol of thinking about and contemplating on what was said, not just the sounds of words spoken. A married man while reading his newspaper, his wife going on about something suddenly, says, "You´re not listening to me, are you?" He replies, "I heard every word you said. You said..." “Yes, but you´re not listening.".	<img src="聴.png">
懐	pocket	pocket, Freud, state of mind, poltergeist, BernaE, ten, needle, eye, cross-eyed, net, top hat, scarf, cloth, clothes, clothing, garment	<b>Genos</b> reaching around <b>Darth Vader's garments</b>, trying to pick his <b>pockets</b>.	(re: taijuando) When you are in New York City you have to be alert, i.e. in the "New York State of Mind": you need ten eyes to make sure no one will go through your garments and pick your pockets.	Imagine Darth Vader´s state of mind when he discovers his garment has not pockets. " D O NOT WANT!".	<img src="懐.png">
慢	ridicule	ridicule, Freud, state of mind, mandala, sun, day, eye, cross-eyed, net, crotch	<b>Genos</b> sees the C-class heroes who just spend all <b>day eyeing crotches</b> and thoroughly <b>ridicules</b> them.	I´ll focus on the mandala primitive here. I guess Heisig chose this keyword for phonetic reasons and as a character it´s the "man" in mandara/mandala (曼荼羅). A mandala is a graphic representation of the universe, here split in 3 planes of existance, the sun representing the cosmos, the eye represents the human observer, the crotch represents the animal instincts.	He´ s often ridiculed for having his eye on crotches all day.	<img src="慢.png">
漫	cartoon	loose, water, water droplets, water pistol, mandala, sun, day, eye, cross-eyed, net, crotch	<b>Water</b>' goes all over the keyboard after you spent all <b>day eyeing crotches</b> on the internet, but you feel ashamed because they were all <b>cartoons</b>.<br><br>(eww but topical, because Japan, and good luck forgetting it now)	One obscure Tibetan sect-- the Otaku cult-- has an unusually loose interpretation of mandala drawing practice. Instead of traditional mandalas they draw mangas (漫画). They then pour water on the image to wash it away, and begin anew.	Even NELSON MANDALA dreams of drops of WATER glistening on comic book/ anime girls with LOOSE morals. (This story has been edited in response reports).	<img src="漫.png">
買	buy	buy, eye, cross-eyed, net, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	Carefully <b>eyeing</b> your <b>money</b> to count it before you <b>buy</b> something.	When something catches my eye, I take out a few clams and buy before anybody else does.	Rules to Buying: 1. You´ve had your eye on it for a while. 2. You have enough shells to afford it.	<img src="買.png">
置	placement	placement, eye, cross-eyed, net, straightaway, ten, needle, eye, fishhook	In a retail store, so your <b>eye</b> sees the goods <b>straightaway</b>, they are <b>placed</b> at just the right height.	On the JET Programme, many people have their eye on a placement in Tokyo, Osaka or another big city, and write it on their application form. They are usually sent to the countryside straightaway.	Working in retail you learn the placement of any item should be at eye level so it´s seen straightaway.	<img src="置.png">
罰	penalty	penalty, eye, cross-eyed, net, say, words, keitai, mouth, sword, sabre, saber	The judge <b>eyeing</b> the defendant as he <b>says</b> he will remove his hand with a <b>saber</b> as <b>penalty</b> for stealing.	For Japanese, when the mind´s eye (the sideways eye) feels guilty for something bad that the body has done, there are two penaltys to choose from. One, you can say I´m sorry. Two, you can commit suicide by sabre. Why, oh why, do so many Japanese executives commit suicide at the first sign of scandal when all the have to do is say I´m sorry to get off the hook. (on yomi: バチ, バツ).	There is a 3-way masterplan for every goalkeeper to prevent a goal at penalty shootout: 1. Look directly into the eyes of the player --- 2. Confuse him by screaming senseless words --- 3. Pull out you your saber and ... (that´s up to you).	<img src="罰.png">
濁	🔺 voiced 🔺	voiced, water, water droplets, water pistol, spider, eye, cross-eyed, net, bound up, insect	The spider, with poison dripping down like <b>water</b> from her fangs, <b>eyes</b> the <b>insect bound up</b> in spiderweb below her, as the insect <b>voices</b> a tiny "help me!"	The fly is wrapped in a spiderweb voicing "Help me, Help Me" under the watchful eye of the spider who´s venom is dripping like water from her fangs.	Pour water over the eyes of a bound up insect if you want to hear a pitiful buzz that is very similar to a VOICED consanant.	<img src="濁.png">
環	ring	ring, king, jewel, ball, trampoline, eye, cross-eyed, net, one, ceiling, mouth, scarf	<b>King</b> Sauron's <b>eye</b> looking down at the <b>ceiling</b> under which Frodo (<b>head and cloak</b>) is hiding with the one <b>ring</b>.	Together with the next kanji, the keywords spell “send back the ring”. First we have a jewel. Next we have the great eye of Sauron searching for the fellowship hiding under the many ceilings during their journey. The fourth and fifth primitives are the mouth of Gollum always mumbling “My preciousss”; and Pippin´s scarf! Placement: the eye appears at the top similarly to how the Great Eye of Sauron is perched atop the Dark Tower.	In conjunction with send back (#837)....... When I tried to give her the jewel ring, she eyed me, threw it to the floor, opened her mouth and tried to speak, she said nothing. She grabbed her scarf and left.	<img src="環.png">

You´ve probably guessed it by now, this is the road that Sam and Frodo take to send back the ring to Mount Doom! (see previous frame, the jewel is replaced by the road).	Continued from ring (#836)....... So I´m on the road going to send back the ring minus the jewel, the hit to the floor knocked it out.	<img src="還.png">
夫	husband	husband, husband, one, large	My <b>husband</b> is great in the bedroom because he has four arms.	Even though it is argued size is not important, I´m sure most women would like their husband to have a big one.	Homer Simpson, as a primitive.	<img src="夫.png">
渓	mountain stream	mountain stream, water, water droplets, water pistol, claw, vulture, husband	About to cross the <b>mountain stream</b>, slightly further down you can see a <b>bird</b> Pokemon fighting with a <b>Machamp</b> - <b>water</b> is splashing everywhere.	The Simpsons are on vacation. Homer stops to take a leak in a mountain stream but gets snatched by an eagle. Hear his scream?	A husband who went fishing at the mountain stream to feed his family, fell in the rapids (we´ll assume this is a large mountain stream). He is saved from the waters by a great eagle. He comes back home with nothing to feed the family, his clothes still dripping wet as he tells his wife of how he was saved by a great eagle, and of course she does not believe him. The story continues in chicken (#1947).	<img src="渓.png">
規	standard	standard, husband, see, telescope, eye, human legs	The <b>husband</b>'s way of <b>seeing</b> things is the <b>standard</b> point of view. Women who disagree are frowned upon.	In the male-dominated world of yesterday, the husband´s way of seeing things was considered the standard point of view. Women who dared to disagree were frowned upon.	Unfortunately, Homer Simpson is the standard model of a husband in American society. (Placement: You have to look in the RIGHT places to find one that doesn´t fit that mold.).	<img src="規.png">
替	exchange	exchange, husband, sun, day, tongue wagging, husband2	Two <b>Machamps</b> spend all <b>day</b> <b>exchanging</b> punches.

The two husbands exchange for a day on the reality TV show (see exchange (#842)) finally goes underway. One of the two husband´s first job is to fix the water faucet in his new family´s apartment. Unfortunately, he isn´t very good at fixing things and after a few failed attempts the entire apartment is submerged in water.	<img src="潜.png">

The drop falling here is the husband´s toupee... he´s already lost his hair once, now he´s losing it again. Such is life, I suppose.	Note: Heisig´s stroke order is wrong. It´s the same as vermilion, drop first. Homer loses/drops his wedding ring.	<img src="失.png">
鉄	iron	iron, metal, gold, lose, drop, husband	<b>Gold</b> that has been <b>dropped</b>&nbsp;will eventually rust into <b>iron</b>.<div><br /></div><div>(I didn't study chemistry. Sue me.)</div>	Iron is a metal that gradually becomes lost due to oxidation and rust.	Compare with pig-iron (#270). In moving from pig-iron to iron, some of the metal´s maleability is LOST. (The only difference between the two kanji is that IRON has knee-less, unbending legs, while PIG-IRON (270) has very supple, bendable legs.).	<img src="鉄.png">
迭	alternate	transfer, alternate, lose, drop, husband, road	When you get <b>lost</b> while on the <b>road</b>, you need to take an <b>alternate</b> route.	When you get lost, you just take an alternate road to get back on track.	When you lose your way, you can always try to tell the wife that you merely took an alternate road. To save time you know. I´m not LOST, I´m just taking an alternate road. Ahem.	<img src="迭.png">

The storehouse is overgrown with slaves. The slaves are to be sold in the store, to differentiate from a warehouse, which doesn´t have the word "store" in it.	Slaves moved flowers from the storehouse in preparation for the parade.	<img src="蔵.png">
臓	entrails	entrails, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, storehouse, flowers, parade, retainer, slave	After you die, the parts of your <b>flesh</b> they put in a <b>storehouse</b> to preserve are the <b>entrails</b>.	You signed your organ donor card, right? So, when you die, your entrails and other body parts will be placed in a storehouse.	Again with the Pyramids, each Pharaoh had their entrails taken out and put into little jars that were shaped in the forms of their Gods and entombed along with the preserved body. So, the entrails are the parts of the body that are placed in the storehouse along with the Pharaoh! Damnit, why can´t they always be this easy? :(.	<img src="臓.png">
賢	intelligent	intelligent, loincloth, retainer, slave, crotch, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	A <b>slave</b> using their <b>crotch</b> to steal <b>money</b> from their master is very <b>intelligent</b>.	An intelligent man is neither slave to his crotch nor to money. But an intelligent slave will know how to use his/her crotch to make money.	Every intelligent man is a slave to two things, his: 1) crotch, and 2) money.	<img src="賢.png">
堅	strict	strict, loincloth, retainer, slave, crotch, soil, dirt, ground	The <b>slave's</b> <b>crotch</b> was <b>dirty</b>, so the very <b>strict</b> master hosed him down in front of everyone.	The strict parent thinks adolescent kids are "slaves to their crotch" (= can´t control their hormones), so he grounds them. Permanently!	I´m very strict about not just sleeping with anyone.

The slave is look to the future, "One day" he thinks "I will be able to recline with all my goods, a tv, stereo and washing machine, and when that day comes I shall be truly happy" he sighs.	Imagine a slave(or in this case, a female porn star) looking to her new gangbang film where she reclines and gets all 3 holes filled at the same...........OK. Very vulgar, but I was inspired by raulir´s clever use of "3 holes".........	<img src="臨.png">

男	male	male, rice field, brains, power, muscle, arnold	In the <b>field</b> using muscle<b> power</b> is the <b>male</b>.	Male is seen here as muscles working in the field, in other words working in the rice fields is the work of the male who are usually stronger. This is more or less the meaning of the original Chinese character.	When it comes to choosing a MAN, I prefer brains over muscles.	<img src="男.png">
労	labour	labor, schoolhouse, owl, crown, power, muscle, arnold	In the <b>schoolhouse</b> using their <b>muscles</b>, the kids are forced to do manual&nbsp;<b>labour</b> and clean the classrooms.

劣	inferiority	inferiority, few, power, muscle, arnold	If you have <b>fewer</b> <b>muscles</b> than everyone else at the gym, you'll have an <b>inferiority</b> complex.	I have an inferiority complex because I have fewer muscles than everyone else at the gym. They all look like Macho Man Randy Savage (power) to me.	I had trouble remembering the relative position of the components, so now I use this story: Even muscular men have inferiority if they have few things above their muscles (i.e., brain cells).	<img src="劣.png">
功	achievement	achievement, craft, powered, power, muscle, arnold	If you <b>craft</b> something with your own <b>power</b>, it's an even better <b>achievement</b>.

Mnemonic "pegasus persuasion power". I think of the hippogriff from Harry Potter as being like a pegasus. To befriend a hippogriff, you have to persuade it you mean no harm, you can do this if you have "pegasus persuasion power".

People encourage you, giving you the power so you can dive off the 10,000m high cliff into the sea.	<img src="励.png">
加	add	add, power, muscle, arnold, mouth	If you eat anymore, you will be adding more カロries. (katakana karo).	If you eat anymore, you will be adding more カロries. (katakana karo).	This is Power Mouth, the most annoying neighbour in the world who always has something to add.	<img src="加.png">

I´m not sure I know about erector sets or tinker toys but I do know about jenga. You play by taking wooden pieces from the middle of a wooden tower and adding them to the top. In this way you erect a very unstable structure.	<img src="架.png">

The answer might surprise you...<div><br /></div><div>...the <b>armpit</b>, because of its smell.</div>	What part of the body has a very, very, very powerful smell? The armpit, of course!	(no important on yomi) The part of Conan´s body that is three times more effective at defeating foes than his muscles are his stinky ARMPITs. [Note: Typically, when the flesh primitive is on the left side it refers to a body part - this helps distinguish in from threaten (#871)].	<img src="脇.png">
脅	threaten	threaten, triceps, power, muscle, arnold, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, power3, muscle3, arnold3	Hold your <b>incredibly powerful</b> arms <u>above</u>&nbsp;your <b>body</b> if you want to appear <b>threatening</b>.	Compare the primitive positions of armpit (#870) and threaten (#871). When your triceps rest alongside your body, they fit snugly against your armpit. When you hold them above your body, however, your posture becomes quite threatening.	Don´t threaten a warewolf.

Co-operation: 3 persons can have the power of ten if they co-operate.	<img src="協.png">
行	going	going, boulevard, going	Looks like a bridge with a pillar supporting each part. Picture the Flash (primitive) <b>going</b> across it at super speed.	I use The Flash for for this primitive; a superhero who is always going very fast.	To me, this looks like a bridge going over a body of water, being supported by columns underneath it. Being that I live near the ocean, I see tourists and vacationers coming and going constantly on the bridge. Because the bridge is so long, it forms an arc to support the structural integrity. You can see that arc here.	<img src="行.png">
律	rhythm	rhythm, Nelson, column, going, line, brush	Imagine the Justice League as a band. The <b>Flash</b> is on drums, using a <b>brush</b> as a drumstick, setting the rather quick <b>rhythm</b> for everyone else (this can only end badly).	The calligrapher´s brush is moving down a column of a script, in rhythm with his meditation.	The army COLUMN walked to the RHYTHM made by the drummer using a cool BRUSH like drum stick. Picturing the brush as a drum stick is not difficult if you´ve seen such a thing in jazz videos.	<img src="律.png">
復	restore	restore, Nelson, column, going, line, fold back, double back, reclining, lying down, sun, day, walking legs	The <b>Flash</b> runs so fast he <b>doubles back</b> time so he can <b>restore</b> the world to how it was before flashpoint.	Before going all the way to the Boss in a Final Fantasy game, you should probably double back to save at a restore point.	The column of soldiers has to double back to restore the peace in the village they just left.	<img src="復.png">

To gain more knowledge of what´s goin on in the world I´m reading column after column of articles in the newspapers, and it takes so much time I´m glued to it till nightbreak.	Imagine fat people......they avoid going outside to exercise and stay glued to their TV set until nightbreak....so of course they gain weight.	<img src="得.png">
従	accompany	accompany, Nelson, column, going, line, horns, mend	When the <b>Flash</b> is <b>horny</b> and wants to '<b>mend</b>' this, he finds a nice girl to <b>accompany</b> him back to his apartment in Central City.

In Medieval Japan, going to see your lord was often a long journey.	The fellowship of the ring is on a long journey through the depths of Khaz Modan. Imagine they walk through the hall of pillars, with only light being from their own candlesticks that. Soon they will meet much more light than they would ever want to...	<img src="往.png">
径	diameter	diameter, Nelson, column, going, line, spool, clod, toilet paper, crotch, soil, dirt, ground	The <b>Flash</b> <b>soils his crotch</b> and is so embarrassed he runs the entire <b>diameter</b> of the Earth to get away from everyone laughing.<div><br /></div><div>(yeah it should probably be circumference but he can phase through the Earth so just roll with it ok)</div>	Scientists recently measured the diameter of Earth by drilling a deep hole and dropping a line of thread off a humongous spool until it got to the other side.	Suggestion: Replace "spool" with "toilet paper/roll". Reasons: (1) Toilet paper/roll usually comes on a spool. (2) Toilet paper is used to clean the soil off your crotch. Story: Measure the diameter of a column (maybe Nelson´s Column in London?) using a roll of toilet paper. Spool also appears in stalk (#715), suspicious (#716), lightly (#717), sutra (#1360).	<img src="径.png">
彼	he	he, Nelson, column, going, line, pelt, branch, ten, needle, crotch, hook	<b>He</b>-man looks like the <b>Flash</b> (because lightning) and his clothes are made of <b>pelt</b>.<br /><br />I don't really know what He-man looks like but I but I think it's something likle Thor with a sword.	What´s the main difference between a he and a she? The he has a column covered in a pelt... a penis. Badum-ching.	The ultimate he-man is the Neanderthal cave man. His club is as big as a pillar (column), and he wears a ragged pelt as his only clothing. To remember the column, imagine the cave man resting the club vertically like a column when not in use.	<img src="彼.png">
役	duty	duty, Nelson, column, going, line, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch	The <b>Flash</b> running to stop a <b>missile</b> because it's his <b>duty</b> as a hero.	Japanese kamikaze pilots (and the American from Dr. Strangelove) are so devoted to their duty that they go with their missiles.	Imagine those poor saps in charge of nuclear silos, responsible for ICBMS, those towering column missiles. When the order comes they must decide whether to obey their concience or do their duty and damn the world to atomic annihilation.	<img src="役.png">
徳	benevolence	benevolence, Nelson, column, going, line, stethoscope, camel, ten, needle, eye, cross-eyed, net, heart	The <b>Flash</b> manages to touch <b>Darth Vader's heart</b> and teach him about <b>benevolence</b>.	Hearkening back to the kanji for LISTEN... Benevolence is a good listener who is willing to go the distance to help.	I was GOING to put a NEEDLE in your EYE, but my BENEVOLENT HEART stopped me. Lucky you.	<img src="徳.png">

The taskmistress in a moment of weakness allowed the man´s column to penetrate her. As punishment he was made to bring up their infant.	Ha! In this frame, a bunch of taskmasters are lined up to penetrate the kids they raise/bring up! I´m thinking of some priests and choir boys.	<img src="徹.png">
徴	indications	indications, sherpa, Nelson, column, going, line, mountain, king, jewel, ball, taskmaster	The <b>Flash</b> defeated the <b>Mountain King's taskmaster</b> by reading the <b>indications</b> of where his attacks would be and counterattacking in advance.	If you see a column of kings being marched up the mountain under a taskmaster´s whip... indications are, there has been a coup.

懲	penal<br><br>(of or relating to punishment)	penal, indications, sherpa, Nelson, column, going, line, mountain, king, jewel, ball, taskmaster, heart	Until <b>indications</b> show you have a <b>heart</b>, you will be <b>penalised</b> for all your wrongdoings.	Penal servitude is served until indications show that one has had a change of heart (learned one´s lesson). Easily confused with punish (#679) and penalty (#833). Concentrate on the reasons behind the penal system ("changing people´s hearts" here), instead of the penalty itself or the punishment (revenge) aspect. It may help to note that there´s no sword, but a heart :-) (Note: 懲りる = learn from one´s bad experiences).	Judge: You will serve a penal sentence until indications show you have a heart.	<img src="懲.png">

The Column of 300 spartans were in a delicate situation. They had travelled in one line (using only their legs) to the mountain pass to face the fierce Persian task master.	Telling your taskmistress (wife) why you are going mountain climbing without her is a delicate situation...

Specifically... ivy boulevard... think hollywood & vine.	<img src="街.png">
衡	balance	equilibrium, boulevard, going, bound up, rice field, brains, large, St. Bernard	The <b>Flash binds up</b> the <b>Reverse Flash</b> to prove whose <b>brain</b> is <b>bigger</b>, but they discovered they are equally<b> balanced</b>.	To maintain the social equilibrium in a future dystopian society, the brains of citizens are bound up (hypnotized). The government is using mental wave emitting statues shaped like St. Bernard´s dogs put alongside the boulevards.	I think BALANCE is an easier keyword. I was walking down a busy French boulevard when between the rushing traffic I saw the wierdest thing. BALANCING on the central crash barrier was a St. Bernard dog, BALANCING a fish on its nose. As I looked closer, I realised it was a trick; it was holding the fish´s tail in its teeth, and only pretending to BALANCE it. (keeps the position of the elements!).	<img src="衡.png" />

The extent to which some people will go to create ´wheat displays´, or as some call them ´crop circles´, is truly amazing.	The wheat crop has come in, and the mouth of the king is gobbling it all up. Everyone is waiting to see... to what extent will the king manage to eat it this year?	<img src="程.png">
税	tax	tax, wheat, cereal, devil, horns, elder brother, teenager, mouth, human legs	Your <b>wheat</b> taken away by the <b>devil</b> as a form of <b>tax</b>.	Nobody likes the tax man, so here it is only fitting that the person who comes over to take some of your wheat is depicted here as a devil. Keep in mind that in feudal societies there was no kind of money to speak of, so taxes were paid by serfs in wheat to the devils who came over to keep them poor.	This is an easy one. Taxes is like the devil taking away your hard earned wheat.	<img src="税.png">

Chances are, he won´t stay on the register for long. My image is close to that of gorgon´s story.	This doctor dilutes (see 227) his patients with bamboo stalks rather than the flowers of a standard diluting acupuncturist hence he needs to be on the Bamboo Accumpunturist Diltuers (BAD) register.

He is easy to imagine, the heavy gold chains are probably the most prominent feature of the character. And last but not least you can always pepper your story with the famous line “I pity da foo!” * Fittingly, on the left side of the kanji, it looks like a “T”.

That makes it easier to substitute Mr. T, Captain Picard, or whomever else a student is using as person.].	<img src="人.png">
佐	assistant	assistant, person, left, by one’s side, craft	On <b>Batman's</b> <b>left</b> is his <b>assistant</b> - Alfred.	Mr T´s assistant is on his left. Why?

So now his assistant is always to his left side, much safer - "Stay on my left, foo!".

個	individual	individual, person, harden, pent in, old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth	<b>Batman</b> is a battle-<b>hardened</b> <b>individual</b>.	This keyword gave me trouble, I could write the kanji from memory but could not remember the keyword the other way around. In such case the dictionary definition can be helpful : "Middle English, single, indivisible".

He walks around upright. "Why should I hide?! I´ve got nothing to be ashamed of!".	NOTE: The second primitive is upright, not eminent. There is an error in the book.	<img src="偵.png">
僧	monk	buddhist priest, person, increase, formerly, horns, rice field, brains, sun, day	<b>Batman</b> <b>increased</b> his training in order to become a <b>monk</b>	Mr. T and the artist formerly known as Prince, who by the way is a buddhist, want to form a new heavy metal band.

But 償 is used in various other compounds. Mr. T sold all his jewelry to give as reparations to slave families. The governent tried to honor his charity by giving him a prize, but it was a shitty outhouse filled with clams.	<img src="償.png">
仙	hermit	hermit, person, mountain	<b>Batman</b> lived in the <b>mountains</b> as a <b>hermit</b> for a while. The more you know.	A HERMIT is a PERSON who lives in the MOUNTAINS.

付	adhere	adhere, person, glue	<b>Batman</b> doesn't need <b>glue</b> to <b>adhere</b> (stick) to the rules.	賀 TO EVERYONE WHO MADE IT TO 千 kanji!!

任	responsibility	responsibility, person, porter, drop, samurai	<b>Batman's</b> <b>porter</b> Robin is Batman's <b>responsibility</b>	It is always Mr. T´s responsibility to be the porter and carry around everyone´s luggage because he´s so strong.	In pregnancy (#507), the woman was the porter for the first nine months. Now, as a new father, Mr.T is assuming all the RESPONSIBILITIES that comes with it.

賃	fare	fare, responsibility, person, porter, drop, samurai, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	It's your <b>responsibility</b> to use the right <b>money</b> for the bus <b>fare</b>.	It´s your own responsibility to pay the bus fare with the correct number of shells/money.	In Japan they have automatic ticket gates so you cant easily cheat on your train fare. In England however the ticket gates are fairly open. It is a different kind of system. In England you are given the RESPONSIBILITY to put in the right amount of MONEY, but if you are caught cheating, the fines are stiff and you feel like a real CHINCHIN. "un.CHIN".	<img src="賃.png">
代	substitute	substitute, person, arrow	<b>Batman</b> with <b>arrows</b> - Green Arrow - is a rubbish <b>substitue</b> for the real dark knight.	Mister T substitutes an arrow for a toothpick -- The keyword meaning is to replace something with something else, to act for another, to represent. It´s best to stick to the first meaning, because the last two are very close to "mediator" which will come in frame 1761. The idea here is that the arrow is not a toothpick, neither it is changed into one, but it can substitute for one.	Mr. T shot the substitute teacher with an arrow.	<img src="代.png">
袋	sack	sack, substitute, person, arrow, garment	An easy <b>substitute</b> for a <b>garment</b> is a <b>sack</b>.	A sack is an easy substitute for a garment.	A worker who was recently sacked from his job, is wearing a sack of potatoes as a substitute garment (naked otherwise), in some kind of protest. The kanji is close to frame 1547 "bag", and although the later really refers to a "straw sack", I use the image of a sack of potatoes here, and that of a "plastic bag" for frame 1547. The keywords would have been better swapped in my opinion, but the relevancy is not so important at this point (see notes of Lesson 31 in the book).	<img src="袋.png">
貸	lend	lend, substitute, person, arrow, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	You must <b>substitute</b> some collateral for  <b>money</b> if you want the bank to <b>lend</b> you any.

化	change	change, person, spoon, sitting on the ground	<b>Batman</b>, with nothing but a <b>spoon</b>, can <b>change</b> the world.	Referring to a scene in the movie "The Matrix" where a girl bends a spoon with the power of her mind alone, I imagine Mister T who changes a spoon into something else (maybe the waiter forgot to bring knives or forks). Note: as a primitive, it can help to use the image of "spare change", this can help you keep it distinct from other similar kanji such as "shape" or "turn into".	Mr. T reaches into his wallet for some spare change but it has all changed into spoons.	<img src="化.png">
花	flower	flowers, change, person, spoon, sitting on the ground	The <b>flower changed</b> into an even bigger <b>flower</b>.	The flowers change with the seasons.	The flower is the essence of transience. So, the conceptual flower involves both the concept of flower plus change.	<img src="花.png">

Freight is the shells (money) paid to change the location of something big. Don´t confuse with the similar 賃 fare (#1004).	This is a freight train that runs on spare change. Imagine getting on the freight train with a bunch of spare change. You put in some change and it starts up...goes for a few minutes, then starts to slow down. You look at the slot..there´s actually a slot for spare change and one for regular shells. Your call, but it seems to prefer spare change over shells.	<img src="貨.png">
傾	lean	lean, change, person, about that time, spoon, sitting on the ground, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight	<b>Change</b> your <b>head</b>'s' position and <b>lean</b> on something comfy.

So he lets the sa-geishas stay.	(re: sweetneet) Since he is not very sagacious, Mr. T failed his driver´s license and now needs to resort to his walking legs to get around.	<img src="俊.png">
傍	🔺 bystander 🔺	bystander, person, traffic cop, fez, vase, stand up, crown, compass, direction	<b>Batman standing</b> in his <b>crown</b> (cowl) and memorises the <b>directions</b> all the <b>bystanders</b>s are going in.	In Japan, the emperor is a bystander - he stands on his crown but can´t really affect the direction of the country. (thx shimouma).	Mr. T is in the street, standing up, wearing an golden crown and a compass in his hand... he´s asking the bystander if they know how to get to buckingham palace (!).	<img src="傍.png">
久	long time	long time, bound up, person, mummy	A <b>bound up person</b> like a mummy - they haven't been seen in a very <b>long time</b>.<br><br>久しぶり - long time no see	Note: this is the ひさ in ひさしぶり .

囚	captured	captured, pent in, person	<b>Batman</b> was <b>pent into</b> a cell after he was <b>captured</b>.	A person pent in is obviously captured. Imagine a man put inside a wooden box, his evil capturers waiting for ransom money.	Mr. T can´t be captured. This kanji is lying.	<img src="囚.png">

丙	third class	third class, one, ceiling, inside, person, belt	On an aeroplane, the low <b>ceiling</b> and the <b>belt</b> that is too big for <b>Batman</b> shows that this is clearly <b>third class</b> - not first class where the billionaire should be sitting!	In this third class flight, the seatbelts are so bad that with the slightest turbulence all the persons hit the ceiling. (it´s almost pictographic here!).	But third class is so small Mr. T´s head hits the celing.	<img src="丙.png">

以	by means of	by means of, plow, drop, person	<b>Batman plowing</b>, a drop of <b>sweat</b> on his brow, <b>by means of</b> hard work.	A man earns his living by means of the plow.

Kanji meanings : to manage, to conduct (business), and also "barracks; camp; encapment". This story should help avoid confusion with post (#824) and employ (#1083).

夜	night	night, top hat, person, walking legs, drop	<b>Batman</b> wears a <b>top hat</b> in the <b>evening</b> - he isn't always dressed as the dark k<b>night</b>!	Actually, the lower-right primitive isn´t quite "walking legs." It´s a little more like "evening" with an extra stroke across it (look up the stroke order). So, it helps me to see this kanji for night as: evening plus an extra stroke representing the tuxedo tails to match the top hat which my special person is wearing out on the town...	Here we have Mister T sleepwalking, wearing a top hat as if he was the ambassador of the night, walking, and walking and walking on his tired walking legs, until he drops (back into his bed).	<img src="夜.png">
液	fluid	fluid, water, water droplets, water pistol, night, top hat, person, walking legs, drop	The <b>water</b> at <b>night</b> is the <b>fluid</b> from your wet dream lol	A wet dream........water fluid that comes out at night....	I imagined some kind of liquid (water) that was discovered on another planet. It solidifes during the day, and becomes fluid only at night, in the absence of light. The question is, could any lifeforms thrive in there ?	<img src="液.png">
塚	hillock	hillock, soil, dirt, ground, crown, pig, sow	Ms. <b>Piggy</b> sitting on top of a mound of <b/>soil</b> in her <b>crown</b> - she's Queen of the <b>hillock</b>	There´s already King of the Hill. This is Queen of the Hillock. It´s Ms. Piggy sitting on top of a mound of soil in her crown.	The crowned sow (we met her in overpowering) is standing atop her little mound of earth - hillock - the undisputed champeen of all the pigsty.	<img src="塚.png">
幣	cash	cash, shredder, small, little, belt, taskmaster, towel	A counterfeiter using a <b>shredder</b> on a <b>towel</b> to make some <b>cash</b>. He ain't foolin' anyone.	A counterfeiter is using a shredder to shred a towel in order to print up some cash (he needs some rag paper) .	In order to create some cash, first you feed a towel through a shredder to get the raw materials. ("Paper" money isn´t plain paper; it´s mostly linen.).	<img src="幣.png">
換	🔺interchange🔺	interchange, finger, fingers, bound up, four, large, St. Bernard		After months of practice, you finally managed to teach a nice trick to your sled-pulling four bound up St. Bernard dogs: one snap of your fingers and they interchange their positions.	On the snap of your fingers, the four St. Bernard dogs bound up interchange places.	<img src="換.png">
融	🔺dissolve🔺	dissolve, tripod, one, ceiling, mouth, hood, human legs, street, nail, spike, insect		I have created the element "old camera" out of the left side of the kanji: from the subject´s point of view, the light is captured by one mouth (the lens). The photographer is under a big hood, we only see his legs, and he is holding a spike in his right hand, which is the shutter release. Now, at the time the photographer takes the photo, a little insect is flying near the flash. The flash is so powerful that the insect is burnt and dissolves in the air.	I´ve seen this crazy thing with only one mouth that can dissolve up to 4 nails and an insect at the same time. Sweet! (It´s a venus flytrap, btw).	<img src="融.png">
施	alms	alms, banner, direction, compass, direction, reclining, lying down, scorpion		Under their banner, volunteers are requesting alms for scorpion sting victims.	It's important that ALMS go in the DIRECTION of SCORPION sting victims.	<img src="施.png">
旋	rotation	rotation, banner, direction, compass, direction, reclining, lying down, zoo, critters		A merry-go-round with a big banner on top and below a veritable zoo of bakelite animals on poles in perpertual rotation accompanied by silly music. Giraffes, elephants, zebras, rhinos...	Don´t confuse with revolve or axis! Think of rotation as a rotation of animals in the zoo - some are on display (in rotation), some are in cages in the back (out of rotation). The ones currently in rotation (on display) are advertised with a large banner.	<img src="旋.png">
遊	play	play, banner, direction, compass, direction, reclining, lying down, child, road	遊び	The BANNER warns that CHILDREN PLAY on the ROAD.	There is always a stupid banner talking about children at play near the road. They mean "drive slowly", but it sounds like its slow(stupid) children that are at play.	<img src="遊.png">
旅	🔺trip🔺	trip, banner, direction, compass, direction, reclining, lying down, Carol in rags, person, rag	Kiiiinda looks like 'TR', like for 'trip'..?<br><br>Yeah I know, sorry	The boat starts to leave on it´s trip across the Atlantic. Underneath a huge banner that spans the width of the ship and says "Bon Voyage", the people wave their rags signalling a safe journey for all on board the Titanic.	After a long long trip, what once was a proud beautiful banner, we had nothing more than a simple rag remaining.	<img src="旅.png">
勿	not	not, knot, piglet’s tail		This kanji is NOT a piglett.	The butcher is standing over the piglet. "This is a piglet...(cuts of head)...NOT!".	<img src="勿.png">
物	thing	thing, cow, knot, piglet’s tail		The cow´s "thing" is tied in a knot! ouch.	A cow is not a thing. Its an animal. If you study japanese you know that living beings and things are discerned from each other with the verbs iru and aru.	<img src="物.png">
易	easy	easy, sun, day, knot, piglet’s tail		The sun is not an easy place to get to.	Under the sun, it is easy to untie a knot. Under a pitch-dark sky, it is knot so easy.	<img src="易.png">
賜	grant	grant, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, easy, sun, day, knot, piglet’s tail		A grant is easy money.	Do you want free shells from the government? It´s easy with my new book, "How to Get a Free Grant from the Government!" Call today!	<img src="賜.png">
尿	urine	urine, flag, water		Animals use their urine to mark their territory. So for them, their body water works as a flag denoting their "country" (why bother? we all know which story you are going to pick).	Someone is pissing on the American flag, but since the urine is clear it looks like water.	<img src="尿.png">
尼	nun	nun, flag, spoon, sitting on the ground		Red cross nuns sit in a tent under the red cross flag, spooning out food to the hungry.	A nun sits in protests under an American flag.	<img src="尼.png">
泥	mud	mud, water, water droplets, water pistol, nun, flag, spoon, sitting on the ground		TV gets weirder and weirder... Now they´re doing mud wrestling shows with nuns splashing around in the water. What will they think of next?	Water monks live in a den, but water nuns live in the MUD.	<img src="泥.png">
塀	fence	fence, soil, dirt, ground, folding screen, flag, puzzle, horns, two hands		[fence; wall; (kokuji)] A fence separates one soil from the other. On a large scale, large pieces of soils in the world have a virtual fence called nation. Picture a world map where all countries have their soil with one color, their national flag as the legend and a fence on the borders... don´t you think it looks like a giant puzzle?	Why the Earth has to be fenced off and flags used to represent each "country" is a puzzle to me - we´re all just monkeys on a big rock spinning round the Sun!	<img src="塀.png">
履	footgear	footgear, flag, restore, Nelson, column, going, line, fold back, double back, reclining, lying down, sun, day, walking legs		NOTE: The most common use is in はく, meaning to put on footgear, rather than actual footgear itself. STORY: You are asleep in camp when you are woken up with news that the FLAG has fallen to the enemy. You quickly PUT ON YOUR FOOTGEAR and run off to RESTORE the FLAG.	You should never use a flag as a shoeshine cloth to restore your footgear.	<img src="履.png">
屋	roof	roof, flag, climax, wall, one, ceiling, elbow, soil, dirt, ground		Flag at the climax (highest point) of a castle roof.	A couple climaxing on the roof, draped in the American flag. The neighbors are mortified and call the landlady...	<img src="屋.png">
握	grip	grip, finger, fingers, roof, flag climax, wall, one, ceiling, elbow, soil, dirt, ground		Fingers gripping the roof as you're about to fall to your death. Think of an action scene in some movie.	(This is the にぎ of sushi). A sushi chef climaxes into a rice ball, wraps it in an American flag, and grips is firm with his fingers to form the "Fuck You America Onigiri.".	<img src="握.png">
屈	yield	yield, flag, exit		When yielding, soldiers raise the white flag before exiting from the trenches.	If you live in Japan, you are only too familiar with the helpful little man who assists you in getting out of every parking lot or parking garage, standing at the exit, waving his flag to make traffic yield to you.	<img src="屈.png">
掘	dig	dig, finger, fingers, yield, flag, exit		If you dig with your fingers hard enough, soil eventually yields.	When you dig, you´d better hope that whatever you´re digging into yields to your fingers. If not, you´re bound to lose some nails.	<img src="掘.png">
居	reside	reside, flag, old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth		A humongous American flag in Florida marks the place where all the old people reside.	It is an old tradition that people plant a flag on places where they decide to reside; this tradition still goes on: Antarctica, the moon: flags all over the place! cf. set (#1064).	<img src="居.png">
据	🔺set🔺	set, finger, fingers, reside, flag, old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth		The man set his finger firmly on the map and said "Here is where they reside, I am certain of it".	Cf. reside (#1063): you set the flag with your fingers on the place where you reside: an old tradition.	<img src="据.png">
層	stratum	stratum, flag, increase, formerly, horns, rice field, brains, sun, day		The strata have piled up in an ever increasing pile of dirt. As the geologists go down the rocks, they flag each stratum with the name of the corresponding era.	Archaeologists at a dig site place small flags marking layers or strata of rock. Each of these layers was formerly the top layer. (This is not increase! Hseige keeps messing up).	<img src="層.png">
局	bureau	bureau, flag, phrase, bound up, mouth		The Federal Bureau of Investigation has email scanners that flag certain phrases.	They do nothing at the bureau other than repeating the stupid catchphrase they have on their flag.	<img src="局.png">
遅	slow	slow, flag, sheep, road		A sheep crossing guard waves a SLOW flag for his fellow sheep crossing the road.	Road sign (flag): "Sheep on highway! Drive slowly.".	<img src="遅.png">
漏	leak	leak, water, water droplets, water pistol, flag, rain, weather		WATER always LEAKED in the spot left by the FLAG planted in the roof everytime it RAINED. Not too hard to picture a hole left in the ceiling from a flag, now leaking water.	Mark the holes where rain water can leak through with little flags.	<img src="漏.png">
刷	printing	printing, flag, towel, sword, sabre, saber		We printed a japanese flag on his white towel by stabbing him with a saber while he was wearing it.	The image that keeps coming to me is of the giant mechanical printing presses. The cloth-based material is coming off the roll like a flag and then, after printing, gets cut into sheets by saber-like cutting tools.	<img src="刷.png">
尽	exhaust	exhaust, shaku-hachi, flag, stick, ice		A women is so exhausted by her "shakuhachi" that see needs to ice her jaw.	That´s not ice...it´s my last drops and I´m exhausted! ;).	<img src="尽.png">
沢	swamp	swamp, water, water droplets, water pistol, shaku-hachi, flag, stick		You´re hiding from the enemy underwater in a swamp. To breathe, you have your shakuhachi flute poking up through the surface of the water.	Sirens in the swamp play eerie music on their shakuhachi flutes to lure you in - you follow the enchanting music then its too late as you get trapped in the swamp!	<img src="沢.png">
訳	translate	translate, say, words, keitai, mouth, shaku-hachi, flag, stick		You cannot pretend to translate into words the melody of the shakuhachi!	You all know that ´shakuhachi´ is a slang word for blowjob, right? In this kanji you got a job as a TRANSLATOR for Japanese porno movies. So you sit there all day translating dirty WORDS and watching girls perform SHAKUHACHI. This is the life!	<img src="訳.png">
択	choose	choose, finger, fingers, shaku-hachi, flag, stick		Hand job or "shakuhachi", choose.	Depending on where you choose to put your fingers, the shakuhachi will produce a different note.	<img src="択.png">
昼	daytime	daytime, shaku-hachi, flag, stick, nightbreak, sun, day, one, floor		Roosters in Japan are very civilised, they play the shakuhachi at nightbreak to signify the beginning of daytime.	In a Zelda game, you can warp to the daytime if you play your shakuhachi to bring about nightbreak... or your ocarina if you don´t have a shakuhachi.	<img src="昼.png">
戸	door	door, one, flag		Traditional Japanese storefront doors have several flags, known as "noren," hanging down from a curtain rod in front of them. I see this as a pseudo-pictograph, and use the horizontal line across the top to represent the curtain rod, since noren don´t usually hang from the ceiling.	A Japanese door has a noren, a flag hanging from a rod. (I give this primitive the meaning of a noren-covered door).	<img src="戸.png">
肩	shoulder	shoulder, door, one, ceiling, flag, moon, month, flesh, part of the body		The shoulder is the best part of the body to bash a door open with (Don´t ever try this. Use your foot).	The shoulder is part of the body you use to push through the noren in a doorway. I was having trouble with positioning of the primitives until I tweaked shaydwyrm´s story slightly. If you think of pushing through a noren, this makes sense as a pictograph. The noren hangs from above, and you push through it from below.	<img src="肩.png">
房	tassel	tassel, door, one, ceiling, flag, compass, direction		Explanation here: http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?pid=14684#p14684.	When you graduate from a school, after they gave you your tassel, they shove you to the door and give you a compass saying "Sayonara & Good Luck out there!" (ボウ).	<img src="房.png">
炉	hearth	hearth-fire, door, one, ceiling, flag		This hearth is equipped with a fire-proof door. On the kanji you can see somewhat pictographically the fire-proof door keeping the fire behind, and nothing comes under the door primitive, where you would have expected to see another primitive.	-"Honey? Do we have any wood left for the hearth?" -"Aagh, just use the frickin´ door!".	<img src="炉.png">
戻	re-	re-, door, one, ceiling, flag, large, St. Bernard		The St. Bernard dog whining at the door of his master’s house in order to re-enter / re-turn inside.	Think about hachiko, the dog waiting at the door of the station, waiting for his master to re-turn.	<img src="戻.png">
涙	tears	tears, water, water droplets, water pistol, re-, door, one, ceiling, flag, large, St. Bernard		I see the story of Hachiko: the faithfull dog who still waited for his master to return long after he had died. Brings a tear to the eye.	Tears are watery (water + re).	<img src="涙.png">
雇	employ	employ, door, one, ceiling, flag, turkey		Our company has no standards. We´ll employ any turkey who walks in the door.	Comedy. An executive is having an argument with a cocky, but skilled, employee: "Damn it, you might be good. But that don´t account for your behavior. You keep this up and I´ll fire your ass." "No, you won´t." "What damn it, I´ll fire you your ass so fast you won´t...know..."-. "And what will you do after you fire me, employ the next turkey that walks through that door?" A turkey then walks through the door and hands the Exec his resume. --"The Exec employs the turkey that walked through the door".	<img src="雇.png">
顧	look back	look back, employ, door, one, ceiling, flag, turkey, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight		I was EMPLOYED to give HEAD...when I look back, maybe that was not a wise career move.	The people we employ are always turning their heads to look back. They don´t want to be caught playing solitare on company time.	<img src="顧.png">
示	show	show, altar, show, two, small		A boy made an altar, but he´s afraid to show it to God because he thinks it´s two little.	I´ll SHOW you mine if you show me yours!, she said. I did & she scoffed because it was TWO LITTLE.	<img src="示.png">
礼	salutation	salute, salutation, altar, fishhook		Indy, my friend, you must be very careful! If you approach the altar and do not give the proper salutation a large fishhook will rip you away.	You should fish hook (bend/bow) your body before an altar as a form of salutation to God/gods.	<img src="礼.png">
祥	auspicious	auspicious, altar, sheep		Bringing a sheep to sacrifice on the altar was a sign of an auspicious life. The poor could only afford a pigeon, the more auspicious an expensive sheep for an offering.	On this ewe-spicious occasion, you sacrifice a sheep at the altar. —— Sorry, but I really need more than generic altar sacrifices to connect keywords to stories. Sometimes an egregious pun is the only way.	<img src="祥.png">
祝	celebrate	celebrate, altar, elder brother, teenager, mouth, human legs		It´s a Bar Mitzvah. At the altar, the teenager is singing in his awful, mid-puberty voice. We´ll all celebrate when that part is over!	When Japanese people turn 20 they usually visit the altar at their local shrine and celebrate no longer being a teenager.	<img src="祝.png">
福	blessing	blessing, altar, wealth, one, ceiling, mouth, rice field, brains		This recalls the selling of indulgences in the history of the Church (As an aside, Protestantism began as a protest of this practice). Basically, one gave wealth to the altar (i.e. priest) and received a blessing. If you prefer a Jewish version, think of the donation (wealth) that is expected when you´re called to the ark (altar in the kanji) to give a blessing over the torah.	Put all your wealth on the church altar and receive one blessing. (You stand up out of your wheelchair or something.).	<img src="福.png">
祉	welfare	welfare, altar, stop, footprint		And in front of every altar, she stopped to pray for the welfare of the others.	Religious Republicans regularly go to the altar to pray for a stop to welfare.	<img src="祉.png">
社	company	company, altar, soil, dirt, ground		When you enter a Japanese company it´s like you join a cult... your workdesk becomes your altar and you worship the very soil the office is built on.	Some Japanese companies, including Toyota, have a Shinto shrine on their grounds to bring luck and prosperity to the company and its employees.	<img src="社.png">
視	inspection	inspection, altar, see, telescope, eye, human legs		The beaurocracy in Japan is such that even altars need to be inspection approved. A little man with glasses comes once a year to give the altar a "visual once over" as he calls it (perhaps checking for unauthorised symbology?).	[inspection; regard as; see; look at] Inspection: you 示 show (#1086) and someone else 見 see (#57).	<img src="視.png">
奈	🔺Nara🔺	nara, large, St. Bernard, altar, show, two, small		It´s beautiful place, but the dark side of Nara is that they sacrifice St. Bernards on evil altars every night after the tourists leave!	Nara is just a big show for tourists.	<img src="奈.png">
尉	military officer	military officer, flag, altar, show, two, small, glue		Of course it had to be the military officer´s idea to glue a national flag to the altar he´s stationed at.	Perhaps you have heard about Koizumis controversial visits at the Yasukuni war memorial shrine. It is the japanese flag waving above a small stone altar. A military officer keeps watch here night and day, to honor the dead war heroes, as if he is glued to the ground.	<img src="尉.png">
慰	consolation	consolation, military officer, flag, altar, show, two, small, glue, heart		A military officer must offer consolation to the hearts of the families of his fallen men.	This Kanji appears in the word 慰安婦 いあんふ, which was what the infamous WW II "comfort women" were called in Japanese. The story goes something like this: As a way of providing consolation to battle-weary, heartsick military officers and soldiers, the Japanese set up comfort stations (brothels) for their servicemen. (Just to be clear: this is not an endorsement of the practice, just a way to remember the Kanji.).	<img src="慰.png">
禁	prohibition	prohibition, grove, tree, wood, altar, show, two, small, tree2, wood2		Similar to radical tyro´s story. If you live in Japan, your main exposure to this kanji is probably "no smoking" signs. So I imagine the government enacting a prohibition of tobacco, and burning whole groves of tobacco plants on an altar (the altar of public health, or self-righteousness, if you will).	Hidden in a grove was a church with a secret altar that was stocked full of prohibited alcohol during the American prohibition period of 1920-1933. A local registered himself as a mininster of this altar so he could stock prohibited alcohol "for sacremental purposes" and share it with his kin (きん).	<img src="禁.png">
襟	collar	collar, cloak, prohibition, grove, tree, wood, altar, show, two, small, tree2, wood2		A collar is the part of your cloak that, if tightened too tight, will prohibit breathing.	Collars are prohibited from wizarding cloaks. Blood purists say they´re too muggle.	<img src="襟.png">
宗	religion	religion, house, altar, show, two, small		I never really did figure out what religion my host family was - all I knew was that they kept an altar in their home.	All the RELIGIONS have their own temples, which are houses where they place their altars.	<img src="宗.png">
祭	ritual	ritual, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, crotch, altar, show, two, small		A ritual such as a circumcision: a small piece of flesh from the crotch is left on the altar.	There are many famous penis matsuris(festivals) in Japan. The rituals of these festivals involve placing the flesh of the crotch on an altar.	<img src="祭.png">
察	guess	guess, house, ritual, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, crotch, altar, show, two, small		I have an informed guess about whose house the dark rituals are performet at.	It´s anyone´s guess who´s house she will wake up in the morning after the festival (祭-matsuri)　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　サツ　警察　けいさつ(police)…　Pure Group:　擦1104.	<img src="察.png">
擦	grate	grate, finger, fingers, guess, house, ritual, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, crotch, altar, show, two, small		If you mis-guess the cheese you´ll grate your fingers on the cheese-grater (happens to me all the time).	Ouch! Guess how many fingers I just grated in the grater? (Edit: OR: Ouch! Guess what I just grated in the grater? -- my finger!).	<img src="擦.png">
由	🔺wherefore🔺	wherefore, sprout, shoot		Wherefore art thou, Sprouteo? (Juliet has fallen in love with a brussel sprout) (OR: A brussel sprout has fallen from Juliet´s dinner plate and rolled off).	Cogito ergo sum. Wherefore is a bad choice here for two reasons. For one, it´s often mistranslated as "where" when in fact it´s an urge to know a cause or reason; and two, because this kanji represents the reason, not the urge. [A thought sprouts from my brain. I think, therefore I am.].	<img src="由.png">
抽	pluck	pluck, finger, fingers, sprout, shoot		[When I see the word pluck, I think eyebrows, not vegetables. So, to avoid confusing with pick (#733):] Each time this singular, long, wiry black hair starts to sprout out of my chin again, I pluck it with my fingers.	If you pluck your fingers, new ones will sprout in their place. (try it ;).	<img src="抽.png">
油	oil	oil, water, water droplets, water pistol, sprout, shoot		The liquid oil that sprouts from an oil field.	In a rather surprising scientific breakthrough, genetically modified Brussel sprouts (which have become extremely absorbative), are thrown in the water to suck up oil spills.	<img src="油.png">
袖	sleeve	sleeve, cloak, sprout, shoot		Imagine some magic cloak, that when worn, has little green sprouts appearing on the sides that grow into sleeves.	The bad magician says, "As you can see, there´s nothing up my sleeves!" Then he trips over his cloak and brussel sprouts fall everywhere.	<img src="袖.png">
宙	mid-air	mid-air, house, sprout, shoot		Jack´s beanstalk sprouted up, pushed at the roof and lifted the house so that it hangs in mid-air suspended on the SPROUT.	Hahaha, the image of walking into a house and finding a sea of brussel sprouts floating mid-air is enough for me to remember. Maybe there´s a magician in the kitchen shouting a reassuring "Don´t mind the sprouts!".	<img src="宙.png">
届	deliver	deliver, flag, sprout, shoot		In the US, when the mail is delivered, a flag sprouts up on your mailbox. (We don´t have that in Australia.).	A Japanese man ordered some Brussel sprouts from Belgium. They are delivered with a little Belgian flag (as seen sometimes in shops, little flags indicating the provenance and authenticity of the food like cheese and meat).	<img src="届.png">
笛	flute	flute, bamboo, sprout, shoot		Flute is made of bamboo sprout.	You pick up your bamboo flute, and recoil in shock as out comes not the dulcet melody you had hoped to play, but rather a Brussels sprout! You play again, and again a Brussels sprout. A bamboo flute that plays sprouts! Fabulous! Puts that golden egg laying goose in its place.	<img src="笛.png">
軸	axis	axis, car, sprout, shoot		Remember the second primitive because it looks like a graph.	An absurd image, but what the heck - worked for me. Imagine a car going across a plain at a fast speed. Suddenly a single sprout (the only one to be seen) gets stuck to the car´s wheels, causing the car to fly around its axis.	<img src="軸.png">
甲	armor	armour, armor, roots		Funny.. this appeared to me as a pictograph of a samurai´s armor. Then I looked up images of the samurai armor and it is not even remotely similar. Then I realised it looks in fact like the belly of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which I somehow associated with the samurai armor because of the "turtle samurai" that appeared earlier. Fits me. The bit that pokes down is to protect the genitals, I guess.	It looks like a bird´s eye view of a tank (modern armor).	<img src="甲.png">
押	push	push, finger, fingers, armour, armor, roots		A child in a museum PUSHes over a priceless suit of ARMOUR with one FINGER.	Push the roots down, instead of plucking the seedling.	<img src="押.png">
岬	headland	headland, mountain, armour, armor, roots		A headland is a mountain that is firmly rooted despite being surrounded on 3 sides by water. (Just like your head is a mountain surrounded by air on 3 sides, a headland!).	Headlands are natural forts; in fact, once men build castles on them, they become armoured mountains. (Gibralter, for example, is basically an armoured mountain).	<img src="岬.png">
挿	insert	insert, finger, fingers, thousand, armour, armor, roots		A rice farmer´s delicate fingers have inserted 1,000 rooted seedlings into his field.	Imagine a crazy japanese hentai: multiple fingers and thousand of root-like tentacles are inserting themselves in... well, I think you can fill the rest.	<img src="挿.png">
申	🔺speaketh🔺	speaketh, monkey, sun, day, stick		I imagine thomeone who can not pronounth the "s" and speaketh like thith becauth they have a cane in their mouth.	I had persistent trouble confusing this one with 曰 sayeth (#578). The way I keep it sorted out is that this one is used in "moshi moshi" when answering the phone, similar to the way an American would say "hello, this is X speaking.".	<img src="申.png">
伸	expand	expand, person, monkey, sun, day, stick		Here we see Mr. T. expanding his gang with some trained fighter monkeys.	Mr. T wants to show you the incredible expanding monkey trick. He grabs a monkey by the tail and neck, stretches him out a few times, then blows him up like a balloon. The monkey EXPANDs until it pops. Haha, sucka monkey, I pity you foo.	<img src="伸.png">
神	gods	gods, altar, monkey, sun, day, stick		The Gods are gathered around debating Zeus´ latest purchase for Mount Olympus. A huge and extremely kitsch gilded altar in the shape of giant "speak no evil" monkey. Hera decides she will never let him go shopping alone again .	Hinduism has many gods, not just one God. One of the most famous of these gods is Hanuman the monkey. Many altars are dedicated to him.	<img src="神.png">
捜	search	search, finger, fingers, Buddha’s hand, monkey, sun, day, stick, crotch		The monkey searches around with his fingers for his crotch.	If you are familiar with the Monkey legends (西遊記 Journey to the West) there is a good image for this character: While searching for the end of the universe, monkey reaches to his crotch and urinates on Buddha´s fingers. (Update: new link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYXFppaKLL4).	<img src="捜.png">
果	fruit	fruit, rice field, brains, tree, wood		If only Eve had used her brains and not taken the forbidden fruit from the tree.	Eve ate fruit from the tree and knowledge filled her brain.…　　　　　　RTK2:　カ　果汁　かじゅう (fruit juice)…　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Semi-Pure Group:　菓1122　課1123　(ﾗ): 裸1124.	<img src="果.png">
菓	candy	candy, flowers, fruit, rice field, brains, tree, wood		This candy is made in the shape of a flower, each petal with the taste of a different fruit.	Candy is coloured like flowers and flavoured like fruit.	<img src="菓.png">
課	chapter	chapter, say, words, keitai, mouth, fruit, rice field, brains, tree, wood		After I finish each chapter of RTK, I eat a piece of fruit to celebrate all the new words I´ve learned. (Thanks Misha!).	Words signify the written words in a book. The fruit represents something whole, complete. A chapter in a book often offers a complete idea, setting, or account. It´s good to disambiguate the keyword from paragraph (#82). To reinforce the kanji, imagine eating a fruit at the end of each chapter of Tolstoy´s "War and Peace" to reward yourself. (If you ate a fruit at the end of each paragraph, you´d very quickly run out of fruit).	<img src="課.png">
裸	naked	naked, cloak, fruit, rice field, brains, tree, wood		Here we have Adam and Eve eating of the forbidden fruit and realizing they were naked, and so clothing themselves in a cloak.

To the right of the door is the standard place for the axe.	<img src="所.png">
祈	pray	pray, altar, axe		Religious freedom has not always been respected throughout history, and nobody knew how to force religion on an indigenous people like the Spanish missionaries.

He kneels at the altar, his battle axe at the ready.	<img src="祈.png">
近	near	near, axe, road		The end is near. The axe-murderer is waiting for you on the road...	An absurd image, but working for me: two points A and B are separated by a long road. To make A and B near, take an ax, cut a big chunk of road, and the work is done.	<img src="近.png">
折	fold	fold, finger, fingers, axe		It´s the latest Japanese game show: Forudo! Contestants are given a sheet of paper and are told to fold it into a complex origami shape. If they´re not done in 60 seconds, a huge axe descends from the ceiling and chops their work in half. Contestants know to recoil their hands from the falling axe, but some have been so absorbed in folding, they ignore the buzzer and get their fingers chopped off.

誓	vow	vow, fold, finger, fingers, axe, say, words, keitai, mouth		This Japanese couple wrote the vows that they had made to each other onto a piece of paper and then folded it into an origami, and put it somewhere in their appartment. To everybody else it is an origami, but to them it is also a symbol of their vows. -- "the folded words are vows". Note : in this story and a few others I use the image of an origami for the primitive "fold".	A Japanese wedding tradition is to present each other with origami cranes with their vows written on the BOTTOM.	<img src="誓.png">
暫	temporarily	temporarily, executioner, chop off, car, axe, sun, day		Your car has been savagely (see steadily) attacked by an ax. It will be some days before your car is fixed.

漸	steadily	steadily, water, water droplets, water pistol, executioner, chop off, car, axe		I imagine firemen working steadily to rescue a man from a crashed car.

断	severance	severance, fishhook, rice, axe		[Based on fuaburisu´s] A man puts some rice on a fishhook as bait, but catches a fish so strong, he needs to take out his axe and sever the line lest he be dragged into the depths.	When you get the ax at work, use your severance pay to buy fishhooks and rice. At least that way you can eat sushi.	<img src="断.png">
質	substance	substance, axe, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, axe2		What is this substance on this clam? I´ve already broken 2 axes on it! (Good question...質問).	Another keyword that I do not like by Heisig. 質【しつ】 (n,n-suf) quality. Story: Your at a local ax dealer and you have TWO AXES which you are testing for QUALITY by trying to split CLAMS right down the opening. Picture yourself succeeding with one AX and then some weird SUBSTANCE comes out of the shell...eww (I don´t like clams).	<img src="質.png">

詐	lie	lie, say, words, keitai, mouth, saw		Pinnochio gets frustrated that every time he utters a word of a lie, his nose grows and he has to get the saw out again.	Her lies are words that cut not like a knife, no not cleanly, but savagely like a saw.	<img src="詐.png">

雪	snow	snow, rain, weather, broom		SNOW isn´t all that different from RAIN, except it can be removed with a BROOM because it only forms in freezing temperatures.	Rain just soaks into the soil. Snow has to be swept away with a broom...　RTK2:　セツ　積雪　せきせつ(pilled up snow).	<img src="雪.png">
録	record	record, metal, gold, dustpan, broom, grains of rice		A monk won a gold metal for breaking the current record for most swept rice in one minute.

尋	inquire	inquire, broom, craft, mouth, glue		The policed inquired into the erotica scandal. They tried to sweep away the evidence, but some of it stuck. (Note: katakana エロ ero in the middle of this kanji is the Japanese word for erotica.).	As a verb this means, this means "to ask; to enquire; to search; to look for; to look into; to investigate;". Imagine the police inquiring in an in-depth investigation. They are interrogating a suspect. But the suspect has a crafty mouth and is very sly. He/she also knows when to keep their mouth shut(glued) at the right moments to avoid self-incrimination. As a final measure, the police torture the suspect by tickling him/her with a broom while they inquire.	<img src="尋.png">

This whole kanji is a picture of calmness. The wheat has been harvested and even the vultures sit calmly watching the humans sweep and clean-up after the harvest is over. Hearts are peaceful and calm at this time of the year. Even the days are calm without storm.	<img src="穏.png">
侵	encroach	encroach, person, French maid, tickle, broom, crown, crotch		The person ENCROACHES on the French maid; driven wild by her little broom, dainty tiara and sinfully short skirt showing her knickers (crotch)!

寝	lie down	lie down, house, turtle, French maid, tickle, broom, crown, crotch		After work, the French maid goes home and lies down with a turtle. Turtle? Well, he´s sloooow and always hard... (thanks to Nukemarine and Wakela!).	After being hit on the head encroach (#1148), the condom salesman goes back to his house to lie down. He hasn´t made a single sale today, so he doesn´t have enough money to buy a pillow. He lies down on his pet turtle and cries himself to sleep.	<img src="寝.png">
婦	lady	lady, woman, feather duster, broom, apron, crown, towel		In high society, a lady is a woman who never touches a broom or an apron.	The LADY of the house is nothing more than a WOMAN who´s a HOUSEWIFE (BROOM and APRON anyone?).	<img src="婦.png">

当	hit	hit, small, broom		Some mothers use a small broom to hit their children when they misbehave.	Here is a weird carnival game where you hold a broom like a javelin and throw it, trying to hit the center of a very small target. The target is so small, in fact, that if someone does manage to hit it, the operator turns in surprise and says, "Whoa, really?! (本当?!)".	<img src="当.png">
争	contend	contend, bound up, rake		This can be seen as a Retarius, a roman gladiator. The Retiarius always fought with a net to bound up his opponents, and with a trident, which was able to pierce enemies after tying them. They were terrific contenders, so they were only paired with gladiators specially equipped to fight them.	A boxing ring is bound up by the ropes. The contender is cheating and using a rake.	<img src="争.png">

I certainly wasn´t going to tell anyone about it.	<img src="事.png">
糖	sugar	sugar, rice, T’ang, cave, rake, mouth		Sugar made from rice has a tangy flavour.	The T´ang are the ones who began using sugar in China--of course, the first thing they tried it on was rice.	<img src="糖.png">

To determine, which patients are sane and can be released, they are given a SIEVE and asked to empty a bathtub (the sane ones take out the plug and get the water out with ease).	People on the cave age became more sane after they started using sieves to avoid eating harmful things with their grains. (This kanji is almost exclusively used to write 健康, health).	<img src="康.png">
逮	apprehend	apprehend, sieve, rake, grains of rice, road		Think police roadblocks. They act like road sieves, letting good people through but apprehending criminals.	In Space Balls, they were combing the desert in order to apprehend Lone Star. Picture Dark Helmet saying "Combing the desert failed, we must now sieve the road!".	<img src="逮.png">
伊	Italy	italy, person, mop		The "boot" of Italy has gotten Europe all muddy. Who else could mop it up but Mr T?	Here I have Mister T cleaning up with a mop, a real mess of spaghetti, in front of the Piza (in Italy).	<img src="伊.png">
君	old boy	old boy, mop, mouth		There´s a tendancy in Japan to make the younger members (kouhai) clean up after the older members (senpai) of a group, which results in a lot of grumbling and whining. "Well old boy," a senpai might say, "If you did as much work with the mop as you do with your mouth, you would have been done an hour ago".	The Beatles, english old boys, had hairs like mop and a good singing mouth.	<img src="君.png">

耐	proof	proof, comb, glue		[akrodha] My comb is rust-proof, water-proof, and fire-proof. But unfortunately it is not idiot-proof--and I glued it to myself.	I spent $100 recently on this excellent rust-proof, water-proof, fire-proof comb. But two days after having bought it, I left it in my back pocket and sat down, snapping this expensive comb in half! I glued it back together, but now every time I try to comb through my thick hair, it just breaks apart again. I guess my comb is also glue-proof.	<img src="耐.png">
需	demand	demand, rain, weather, comb		Supply and demand is a simple concept: when it rains, the demand for combs goes up to deal with wet hair.	If it´s raining combs, then the demand for them sure does drop.	<img src="需.png">
端	edge	edge, vase, stand up, pick-axe, mountain, comb		Have you ever seen those shots in movies where the hero is standing at the edge of a sheer mountain face, hair blowing in the wind? It probably wouldn´t seem so heroic if you saw him ten minutes earlier, when a crew of stylists was carefully combing his hair so it would fall perfectly.	When you stand a comb on its edge, it looks like the mountain (#768) kanji.	<img src="端.png">
両	both	both, street, nail, spike, belt, shovel		Primatives celing; belt; mountain as per Cumulative Errata. See volfy post for link. Both effective ways to commit suicide, hang your self from the celing with your belt or jump off a mountain.

満	full	full, water, water droplets, water pistol, flowers, both, street, nail, spike, belt, shovel		Add water THEN the flowers. With both the vase will be full.

Am I still hungry or thirsty? Thank you for asking! How kind! But no, I feel quite full now.	<img src="満.png">
画	brush-stroke	brush-stroke, one, ceiling, sprout, shoot, shovel		You decide one day to paint a kanji on your ceiling. Unfortunately, you don’t have a brush, so, being innovative, you use a sprout. Knowing it could be messy, you search for a drop-cloth, but can’t find one. Instead, you put a shovel down on the floor to catch any drips resulting from the BRUSH-STROKEs.	To paint a kanji in your ceiling with only natural materials, you use a sprout as a brush and shovel some dirt to use as paint for your strokes. [modified from johnskb´s].	<img src="画.png">
歯	tooth	tooth, stop, footprint, bag of rice, shovel		Stop shoveling rice into your mouth, you´ll hurt a tooth! Use chopsticks instead.	My dentist used his foot and a shovel to dislodge the rice stuck between my teeth.	<img src="歯.png">
曲	bend	bend, rice field, brains, stick		It looks like the mouth of Bender the robot, from Matt Groening´s animated series "Futurama". Thus, I use the character Bender the robot as a primitive.	Also means "melody". Think of it as a pictogram of a guitar where you have to bend the strings to make a melody.	<img src="曲.png">
曹	cadet	cadet, one, bend, sun, day		A space cadet eager to make one bend around the sun. (a dangerous maneuver).	Bender lasted just one day in the space cadets.	<img src="曹.png">
遭	encounter	encounter, cadet, one, bend, sun, day, road		Close encounters of the third kind. The space cadet encounters aliens on the road.	Bender the cadet (see frame 1172) has an "encounter of the third kind" on the road. Reference to Steven Spielberg´s 1977 movie "Close Encounters of the Third Kind". Also a reference to popular stories of people reportedly chased by UFO´s while driving on the road.	<img src="遭.png">
漕	rowing	rowing, water, water droplets, water pistol, cadet, one, bend, sun, day		Bender the cadet (see frame 1172) is rowing, during some army exercise, and he´s very afraid of water (Bender is a robot).	The space cadet is in training, rowing in the water (see it splash).	<img src="漕.png">
槽	vat	vat, tree, wood, cadet, one, bend, sun, day		Also as part of some army survival exercise, the cadets (including Bender see frame 1172) are sent into the woods to build a vat (for collecting water for example).	Bender the Cadet (kudos to Fuaburisu) is found on an army training exercise, hiding behind a tree, getting drunk on the famous scotch whiskey Vat 69.	<img src="槽.png">
料	fee	fee, rice, measuring cup, big dipper, The Plough, drop, ten, needle		When buying rice, the fee is calculated by the cup. Naturally we don´t just use any cup; it has to be a proper measuring cup.	Samurai(s) once received their fee in the form of rice that had been carefully weighed in a measuring cup beforehand.	<img src="料.png">
科	department	department, wheat, cereal, measuring cup, big dipper, The Plough, drop, ten, needle		The national DEPARTMENT of WHEATS and MEASURES. Get it? This one was hard until I came up with this.	Agriculture/astronomy departments...　　　　　　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　カ　科学　かがく (science).	<img src="科.png">
図	map	map, pent in, measuring cup, big dipper, The Plough, drop, ten, needle		Can´t see direct relation to Big Dipper (#1177) since its writing order is completely different. As raulir noted, it´s written as overlapping at the last stroke of ツ and the first of メ. I take it as a pictograph or treasure map. Two dots represent big trees and the cross (marking the treasure) is placed relative to them.	A pictograph of a treasure map. Two steps east then X marks the spot. 図る はかる attempt, deceive; 地図 ちず map; 意図する いとする make a goal, intend to do.	<img src="図.png">
用	utilize	utilize, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, walking stick		To tenderize meat in an emergency wilderness situation, just utilize your walking stick!	I´ll confuse this with use (#990), so build a distinction right from the start. For me, "utilize" has an artificial, business-speak connotation; you only utilize "utilize" when you´re trying to puff up what you´re saying and sound important. So: "BioTools Inc introduces the FG2000 screwdriver, utilizing the our latest FleshGrip(tm) technology!" I´m seeing this as a picture of a stubby screwdriver with a handle made of flesh, a short shaft, and prongs to hold a screw in place until you drive it.	<img src="用.png">
備	equip	equip, person, flowers, cliff, screwdriver, utilise, utilize, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, walking stick		Mr. T wants to climb up and pick the flowers at the top of the cliff. He equips himself with screwdrivers to use as climbing spikes to reach the top of the cliff. Imagine a large AMMO belt full of philips screwdrivers instead of bullets.	An RPG where you´re using Mr T as a character. Before you enter a battle, you equip the flower cliff screwdriver. This is a small screwdriver obtained at the bottom of a cliff that, when used in battle, shoots out pink flowers. When they touch the ground in front of the enemy, they create a massive cliff, and the ground under the enemy falls away into the sea. Picture being at the item select menu and EQUIPping this item just before facing a tough boss.	<img src="備.png">
昔	once upon a time	once upon a time, salad, flowers, one, floor, sun, day		Once upon a time, the children were forced to eat their salad every day.	For those who don´t know the expression, "salad days" means the time of one´s youth. (originally from Shakespeare´s Antony and Cleopatra - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_days). I suspect Heisig chose "salad" as the name for the radical just for this phrase...	<img src="昔.png">
錯	confused	confused, metal, gold, once upon a time, storyteller, salad, sun, day		A long time ago, people of the world got confused because there were so many kinds of Metal coins. today we only have the euro.	Once upon a time, it was thought that the ancient "art" of alchemy could transform anything into gold. At that time, people were obviously confused about the difference between reality and myth. (Arguably people are still as confused as ever, just about different things now.).	<img src="錯.png">
借	borrow	borrow, person, once upon a time, storyteller, salad, sun, day		Once upon a time I let Mr T borrow my salad bowl, but he won´t give it back. "This be mine now, foo!".	Mr. T borrowed a copy of Cinderella and won´t give it back. He keeps watching it over and over again, trying to figure out how the Fairy Godmother does her magic.	<img src="借.png">
惜	pity	pity, Freud, state of mind, once upon a time, storyteller, salad, sun, day		What a pity! My state of mind when i think of the opportunities I missed from once upon a time.	Data says "What a pity" when he hears that once upon a time there were no robots.	<img src="惜.png">
措	set aside	set aside, finger, fingers, once upon a time, storyteller, salad, sun, day		Long ago our ancestors set aside the use of fingers and began to use cutlery. (Raichu,11-7-2006) The way I remember it´s 昔 once upon a time (#1184) rather than 旧 olden times (#35) is that they began to use cutlery to eat salad. (I also think about how when you visit the Medieval Times theme park, which is set in Once upon a time, their gimmick is that you eat with your fingers.).	Once upon a time... Oh hell, you´re just too old for this. You close your fairy tale book and set it aside, pushing it away with your fingers.	<img src="措.png">
散	scatter	scatter, salad, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, taskmaster		The taskmaster is dissatisfied with the meal she´s served, and scatters the salad & meat across the floor for the servants to clean up.	Perhaps you´ve heard of Nyotaimori or Nantaimori (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyotaimori) in which sushi is ate from the flesh of a naked person, the story comes easily. Scatter salad over the flesh of the taskmaster in preperation for some nantaimori :).	<img src="散.png">
廿	twenty	twenty		A generation is 30, one stroke less is twenty.	Ten plus ten is twenty (see generation (#28)).	<img src="廿.png">
庶	commoner	commoner, caverns, cave, twenty, oven-fire, barbecue		Commoners have to huddle in caverns around a campfire, while higher class people get heating and central air conditioning in a hotel.	If you are so poor that you are a commoner, you will have to live twenty commoners to a cavern, with only one fire for everyone to share.	<img src="庶.png">
遮	intercept	intercept, commoner, caverns, cave, twenty, oven-fire, barbecue, road		The commoners are revolting! We must intercept them on the road before they reach the castle!	If don´t want your secret message to be intercepted, make sure your deliveryman is dressed as a commoner while traveling on the road.	<img src="遮.png">
席	seat	seat, caverns, cave, twenty, towel		Remember those poor commoners huddled in groups of 20 in a cave? The only thing they had for a seat was some old toweling (while their lords could recline on luxurious couches).	You´re tired from walking the tour at this cavern and there´s no benches to sit down on, so you take a towel and sling it up into a hammock-like seat using the stalagmites. (Big no-no).	<img src="席.png">
度	degrees	degrees, caverns, cave, twenty, crotch		The cavern refugees are so poor that they can´t afford thermometers. So, the menfolk expose their crotches inside the cavern, and approximate the temperature in degrees from how shrivelled everything looks downstairs...	The cave is twenty degrees cooler than the outdoors. Twenty male crotches experience shrinkage.	<img src="度.png">
渡	transit	transit, water, water droplets, water pistol, degrees, caverns, cave, twenty, crotch		This particular form of transit is a ferry (one of the actual meanings of this character). Naturally it can only cross the water if it´s not frozen, so the temperature must be above 0 degrees.	The transit system in Tokyo is one of the best in the wrold, but why is it that when it is 35 degrees outside, it is about 2 degrees on the train? Or when it is 2 degrees outside, it is 35 degrees inside the train. This degree of difference means I am always sweating then getting the chills! I think I caught a fever!	<img src="渡.png">
噴	erupt	erupt, mouth, pitchfork, haystack, ten, needle, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, needle3, ten3		History of Pompei: An unexpect eruption and from the mouths of the volcano come lava that threatens the farmers collecting haystacks in the fields and the fisherman catching shells on the coast.	A bit nasty (but makes the whole thing much easier to remember) is to take the right side and call it a bearded clam. For erupt, you can make your own story about the mouth/opening on the left.	<img src="噴.png">
墳	tomb	tomb, soil, dirt, ground, pitchfork, haystack, ten, needle, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, needle3, ten3		After the eruption all is a tomb. The soil has covered the remains of the farmers gathering haystacks and of the fisherman collecting shells.	Using soil and hay to make bricks, the Egyptians built the pyramids to entomb the Pharaohs along with all of their money.	<img src="墳.png">
憤	aroused	aroused, Freud, state of mind, pitchfork, haystack, ten, needle, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, needle3, ten3		Note: this word in Japanese has the idea of "indignant". So aroused here refers to being aroused because of anger over some unjust or wrong act, unfairness etc. It doesn´t seem to carry a meaning associated with arousal in the sense of sex or pleasure. So, my story: think of the angry state of mind aroused at finding all your clams buried under your haystack stolen, gone!	Data was aroused/indignant when he saw what the volcano had done to the farmers building their haystacks and the fishermen collecting their shells . The tragedy of it all aroused him so much he didn´t even notice he was feeling emotion.	<img src="憤.png">
焼	bake	bake, hearth fire, lofty, strawman, wickerman, haystack, ten, needle, one, human legs, needle3, ten3		Ah, there´s no better way to bake a pizza than an oven fueled by a burning strawman. And if you listen carefully, there are stifled strawman screams coming from the kitchen. Think of this image: http://users.mtrx.net/funnypics/content/-rdm1-ABCD1234-rdm1-/2005/2005-08-23-0002/Doughboy.jpg.	Too lofty (#2095)尭 a career choice for the strawman becoming a baker. He was fired soon after starting his first shift. Literally!...　　　RTK2:　ショウ　全焼　ぜんしょう(entirely destroyed by fire).	<img src="焼.png">
半	half	half, small, ten, needle		Imagine karate chopping the number three in half with a WALKING STICK and pausing the picture just as the first "board" breaks.	I think of this as a pictograph, there are three boards to cut, the first one is already in half and there are still two more to go.	<img src="半.png">
伴	consort	consort, person, half		The person who is your consort is most commonly "your other half".	Mr. T wants to splits himself in half so he can be his own CONSORT.	<img src="伴.png">
判	judgement	judgement, half, sword, sabre, saber		In the bible, King Solomon´s JUDGMENT was admired not by saying to cut the baby in HALF with the SWORD, but that it revealed who the true mother was.	It takes good judgement to cut things in exactly half with a saber.	<img src="判.png">

Note: This kanji is most often used in a military context. Story: Here we see an encampment of military vehicles laying siege to The Pinnacle.

The proper, high-class way to descend The Pinnacle is wearing a monocle with your walking legs splayed to a full gentlemanly stride.	After a cool, hip businessman angered the executives at The Pinnacle, they beat him up, popping out a lens from his sunglasses, and tossed out the window, head first, walking legs second.

隔	isolate	isolate, pinnacle, parthenon, acropolis, tripod, one, ceiling, mouth, hood, human legs, street, nail, spike		The Pinnacle, to me, is a city that makes itself out to be perfect but is filled with dirty secrets that photographers are always trying to reveal (see dissolve (#1044) The city´s councilmen have isolated all professional photographers to make sure they don´t photograph these "dirty secrets".

The fingers of course, a crown (her too short skirt) and her legs below (which to be honest are pretty thick like tree trunks).	Note: The combination "crown +human legs" appears seven times in Heisig. In four cases (nos. 323, 1327, 1328, 2920) the crown is above the human legs, and in the other three cases (1888, 2472, 2679) one leg passes through the crown. The naming is inconsistent, so I call the first pattern "Miss World" (who is wearing a crown she won due to her attractive human legs) and the second "garter" (one human leg passes through the crown and wears it as a garter).	<img src="探.png">
深	deep	deep, water, water droplets, water pistol, paper punch, Miss World, hole, house, human legs, tree, wood		If the groper´s "tree" goes up the girl´s miniskirt too deep, he´ll ejaculate fluid.

Imagine Normandy after the strikes on the beach. The water of the entire seacoast dyed red with the blood of thousands of soldiers.	<img src="浜.png">
糸	thread	thread, spiderman		I also went with Spiderman. However, in the cases where this primitive appears under other primitives, as opposed to on the left (I think there are ~5 times in this chapter) I´ve opted to use a similar character: Venom. This helps keep the positioning clear, especially on such characters as dainty (#1363) and accumulate (#1364).	You´ll be seeing this one a lot. Seriously.	<img src="糸.png">
織	weave	weave, thread, spiderman, kazoo, sound, vase, stand up, sun, day, fiesta		Spiderman weaves his way through the skyline while listening to his theme song on his ipod. It is played, of course, by kazoos.	Play the kazoo magically and the thread will weave itself.	<img src="織.png">

Luckily, as he can shoot out threads darning is very easy for him to do.	Darning is too obscure a word for me, I prefer to just think of it as repair.

繁	luxuriant	luxuriant, cleverness, reclining, lying down, mother, breasts, taskmaster, thread, spiderman		Important: Luxuriant does NOT mean luxurious, as the other stories indicate. Definition: abundant or lush in growth, as vegetation. When Venom realized he couldn´t beat Spider-Man in a fair fight, he showed his cleverness by spraying venom all over Spider-Man´s luxuriant garden.	Venom is covered in a luxuriant and surprisingly clever symbiotic suit, but it´s also the taskmaster for his every evil act.	<img src="繁.png">
縦	vertical	vertical, thread, spiderman, accompany, Nelson, column, going, line, horns, mend		When Spider-man does his amazing vertical wall climbing, a throng of photographers accompanies him to get a good shot of the action.

Sovereign yelping : ´ we will draw are troops back! and we will spend more money on healthcare, schools and less on wars!´ Spidey whispering: ´ If you continue at this pace, you might be doing good things AND the people will like you.´.	The sovereign appears to be ruling, but in reality someone behind him (for instance his wife) has a thread around his throat, and if he dares to make a decision she doesn´t like, she starts pulling the thread and tightens it around his throat.	<img src="締.png">
維	fiber	fiber, thread, spiderman, turkey		Hey, Spidey! Eat that turkey if you want, but make sure you eat some fibers: you want spidey threads, don´t ya?

練	practice	practice, thread, spiderman, east, tree, wood, sun, day		Spidey stays on the east side of the city to practice. The West Side is too dangerous.

続	continue	continue, thread, spiderman, sell, samurai, crown, human legs	Dr Octopus said, "Sell Spiderman to me if you want your life to continue."	Even though Peter Parker has become Spiderman, he continues to sell pictures that he takes as a photographer.	Here´s how Spiderman comics sell: At the end of the comic they leave with with a cliffhanger and say "to be continued". In fact, the japanese verb 続く is used in comics and tv shows to mean "to be continued". They have adapted the model created by Spiderman to hook the readers so that they can sell more comics.	<img src="続.png">
絵	picture	picture, thread, spiderman, meeting, one, wall, umbrella, rising cloud, two, elbow, wall	There are no PICTURES of SPIDERMAN ever MEETING Peter Parker.	There´s never a picture of Spiderman meeting Peter Parker... I wonder why?	Peter Parker´s editor tells him "Next time you have a meeting with spiderman take a goddamn picture, you´re a photographer after all".	<img src="絵.png">
統	overall	overall, thread, spiderman, allot, infant, toddler, top hat, elbow, human legs		Spidey is alloted the biggest crime fighter jurisdiction in NYC because his OVERALL arrest record is the best.

結	tie	tie, thread, spiderman, aerosol, samurai, mouth		Ok, here, you have to think of the phrase "TIE the knot" , which means a wedding (this kanji is used in the marriage compound 結婚 けっこん ). Now, at US weddings, it ends with the couple driving away with cans being dragged behind the car. So here, think of SPIDERMAN, who will TIE the knot with Mary Jane. At his wedding, Spider THREAD attached (or TIED) to SPRAYCANS are being drug behind the limo as they drive off.	Spiderman and a fan have a competition to see who can tie up the most enemies fastest. Spidey´s using his webs and the fan is using an aerosol can of silly string. So far they are tied.	<img src="結.png">
終	end	end, thread, spiderman, winter, walking legs, ice, drop, drop2		This winter is so cold that spiderman´s web gets brittle! Could this be the end of spiderman?	Spider-Man can´t wait for winter to end. Going outside in spandex isn´t exactly toasty.	<img src="終.png">
級	class	class, thread, spiderman, reach out, outstretched hands		This Kanji is the same ones used in the Japanese Language proficiency tests; i.e. ikkyuu (一級) The Kanji doesnt describe class as in a "class of students" or "classroom," but rather a grade of quality or ability. ---------- Spiderman is taking the JLPT Level 1. In desperation he REACHES OUT to grab his friend´s answer sheet next to him, who seems to be doing well. The other test takers are obviously a class above him.

Fortunately, the hospital reached an out-of-court settlement with the victim´s family.	<img src="納.png">
紛	distract	distract, thread, spiderman, part, eight, sword, dagger		Spiderman got distracted when someone yelled, "Spiderman, wait a minute." He turned around and flew into a building.

All those pathways end up like a huge ball of thread tangled together. The more knowledge you accumulate the more threads you throw into the mix!!	(dingomick) Venom is upset because Spidey is just that much brainier than he is! He chooses to accumulate as many brains as he can, snatching them out of people´s heads and storing them on top of his own, till there´s just one massive brain on top of his head!	<img src="累.png">

継	inherit	inherit, thread, spiderman, rice, fishhook		Spider-Man is hooked on rice--it´s all he inherited from his Uncle Ben. (thanks Nukemarine).

Spiderman finally caved in and decided to keep the little pig under one condition: the pig was to take a broom and sweep up all of Spiderman´s leftover threads after having fought crime.

縄	straw rope	straw rope, thread, spiderman, eels, sun, day		The tortoise has escaped! We tied it up with a straw rope, but all that´s left of the rope are some torn threads, and the unbound tortoise is nowhere to be found. (Note that the right half here is not "eels". This is (in my opinion) a mistake in the RTK book, as we already decided in waterfall (#537) to refer to the simplified form of dragon as "eels". It is much better to call the right half of this character an "unbound tortoise".).	When Spiderman fights the giant tortoise, he grabs a straw rope from the edges of the sumo ring and swings it at his head. However, the tortoise quickly tucks his head back into his shell to avoid the blow (hence no head on the tortoise).	<img src="縄.png">

機	mechanism	mechanism, tree, wood, abacus, how many, cocoon, person, fiesta, cocoon2		An abacus is a mechanism made of wood used to calculate how many ´anythings´.	To avoid confusing with contraption (#677), focus on the "ism" of mechanism. For example, fetishism refers to having a fetish; mechanism here refers to having a mecha-like property, where mecha is a type of anime robot that can transform itself. Imagine a mecha that can transform itself between two forms: a huge immovable tree (as a form of defense) and a gigantic marching abacus that smashes enemies between its giant beads.	<img src="機.png">
玄	mysterious	mysterious, top hat, cocoon		What could be more mysterious than a cocoon in a top hat trying to sneak in...? (Pimitive: GANDALF).	The invisible man in his top hat and cocoon of white bandages is the most mysterious man in the world.	<img src="玄.png">
畜	livestock	livestock, mysterious, top hat, cocoon, rice field, brains		The livestock are disappearing! I´ve placed Gandalf over the rice field to protect them.	This mysterious rice field grows not only rice, but livestock too! Picture little pigs and chickens growing right out of the ground, among the rice plants. How bizarre!	<img src="畜.png">
蓄	amass	amass, flowers, livestock, mysterious, top hat, cocoon, rice field, brains		One sneaky farmer wanted to amass a large collection of livestock. We all know that cows like to eat flowers, so he planted lines of flowers leading to his own fields. The livestock followed the lines, eating the flowers one by one, and amassed in his field.	Kobe beef. The Japanese amass a fortune pampering livestock feeding them flowers, offering beer, playing music and giving them massages… RTK2:　チク　蓄電池　ちくでんち(battery cell)…　Pure Group:　畜1384.	<img src="蓄.png">
弦	bowstring	bowstring, bow, mysterious, top hat, cocoon		A magic bow that only Gandalf can yield: there is no bowstring on it, and he uses his magic to fire arrows.	A bow with a mysterious invisible bowstring.	<img src="弦.png">

滋	nourishing	nourishing, water, water droplets, water pistol, double-mysterious, mothballs, horns, one, cocoon, cocoon2		Water is doubly mysterious. It´s in all our nourishment...and yet, it´s really not nourishing at all.	Going off the idea of the right side meaning rapid growth/increase of small objects, I´ve decided to make the right side be Gremlins, those little mysterious creatures that double rapidly. Gremlins find water a little too nourishing, as it makes them instantly multiply.	<img src="滋.png">
慈	mercy	mercy, double-mysterious, mothballs, horns, one, cocoon, heart, cocoon2		Mercy comes from the doubly mysterious heart of God.	Here we see the DOUBLE-MYSTERIOUS Siamese twins again, at the MERCY of the machines that pump blood through their veins, since the single HEART they share won´t do the job...	<img src="慈.png">
磁	magnet	magnet, stone, rock, double-mysterious, mothballs, horns, one, cocoon, cocoon2		A magnet is a rock with two sides; one that mysteriously pushes and one that pulls; doubly mysterious. (see astridtops´ story).	I found some stones on the siamese twins. Turns out the stones were magnetic, and they weren´t siamese twins at all!	<img src="磁.png">
系	lineage	lineage, stick, drop, thread, spiderman		(Primitive: DNA, a drop of looong spiraled thread that is the key to your lineage).	Spiderman´s lineage (who his family is etc...) can be found in his DNA in a drop of blood. The villain that gets blood of Spidey will be able to find out who is family and lineage is. be carfefull spidey...	<img src="系.png">
係	person in charge	person in charge, person, lineage, drop, thread, spiderman		Mister T gets a DNA test, and discovers that he was meant to be the person in charge after all.	The person in charge usually must come from a long standing lineage of persons in charge.	<img src="係.png">
孫	grandchild	grandchild, child, lineage, drop, thread, spiderman		Your grandchild is the child of your DNA.	Your child continues the family lineage by passing on your DNA, giving you a grandchild.	<img src="孫.png">
懸	suspend	suspend, prefecture, eye, fishhook, small, little, lineage, stick, drop, thread, spiderman, heart		The prefecture has suspended all DNA research for heart disease because of corruption. All involved will be suspended by their wrists.	The prefecture has suspended all research into inheritable (lineage) heart disease.	<img src="懸.png">
却	instead	instead, gone, soil, dirt, ground, elbow, stamp		[instead; on the contrary; rather] Gone is the time for stamps - use e-mail instead.	If you tried to attach money to an envelope to pay for postage it would be GONE before it arrived at the post office. That´s why we use STAMPS instead.	<img src="却.png">
脚	shins	skids, shins, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, instead, gone, soil, dirt, ground, elbow, stamp		Shins are the part of the body that one uses instead of one´s eyes, for finding furniture in the dark. (Ouch!).	Shins are the part of the body that Japanese traditionally sit on instead of their asses.	<img src="脚.png">
卸	wholesale	wholesale, horseshoe, horse, pantomime horse, noon, sign of the horse, stop, footprint, stamp		Selling WHOLESALE HORSES over the internet had to be STOPPED because the cost of STAMPS was too much.	If you need horseshoes (shoes that fit your horse´s footprint), buy them at the wholesale shop. They lick and paste stamps in your membership card so you can get free merchandise later.	<img src="卸.png">
御	honorable	honorable, Nelson, column, going, line, wholesale, horseshoe, pantomime horse, noon, sign of the horse, stop, footprint, stamp		An honorable man will not try to cut in front of the line at the wholesale stamp store. (Imagine just how much honor it takes facing those long lines at the post office!).	In front of the COLUMNS of the Capitol, the HONORABLE congressmen can be bought WHOLESALE.	<img src="御.png">
服	clothing	clothing, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, underpants, stamp, crotch		It´s customary to cover the flesh with clothing, but some designs are so outrageous they´re not bigger than a stamp that just covers your crotch.	Modern clothing shows a lot of flesh -- some is practically no more than a postage stamp covering your crotch!	<img src="服.png">
命	fate	fate, fit, meeting, umbrella, one, mouth, stamp		When you´re born, your fate is measured, fitted, and stamped onto your soul. Good luck defying it.	Mouth meets stamp. Mail the letter to the university and wait on fate…　RTK2:　メイ　一生懸命　いっしょうけんめい(with all one´s might)　　　　　　　　ミョウ　寿命　　じゅみょう　　(span of one´s life).	<img src="命.png">
令	orders	orders, meeting, chop-seal, hanko		(re: dingomick) "These are your orders," declares the general while passing out documents at the meeting. As everyone started to leave, the general exclaims "Oh wait! I need to certify these orders!" and went around stamping each paper with his personal chop-seal.	These are your orders, declares the general at the meeting as he stamps them with his chop-seal. (Primitive: chop-seal imaged as a papal ring, the one´s they would press into wax as their official seal. Also a cattle brand.).	<img src="令.png">
零	zero	zero, rain, weather, orders, meeting, chop-seal, hanko		The amount of people that can order the rain to rain.	Despite the rain, the zero pilot flies on. He has kamikaze orders.	<img src="零.png">
齢	age	age, teeth, tooth, stop, footprint, rice, shovel, orders, meeting, chop-seal, hanko		You know you are fast approaching a ripe old AGE when you get ORDERS from the dentist to get new TEETH.	The tooth fairy has orders to stop giving money if a child is a certain age. RTK2:　レイ　高齢　こうれい(advanced age)…　　　　　　　　　　　　Semi-pure group: 　令1401　零1402　冷1404　鈴1406　(ﾘｮｳ): 領1405.	<img src="齢.png">
冷	cool	cool, ice, orders, meeting, chop-seal, hanko		To keep your water cool, just order some ice.	The Japanese boss gives an order at the meeting: eat ice to stay cool (since they won´t be running the air conditioning anymore).	<img src="冷.png">
領	jurisdiction	jurisdiction, orders, meeting, chop-seal, hanko, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight		Two cowboys are crossing a state limit. One says to him “Did you know that in this Jurisdiction there are Orders to get your head?”, so he takes out his gun and shoots him. He claims the reward afterwards. (Thanks Fuaburisu).	Orders are given by the head person in any jurisdiction.	<img src="領.png">
鈴	small bell	small bell, metal, gold, orders, meeting, chop-seal, hanko		Some restaurants have a small gold bell to call someone to take customers´ orders.	In high society, people ring a small golden bell to call their servants and give their orders.	<img src="鈴.png">
勇	courage	courage, chop-seal, hanko, male, rice field, brains, power, muscle, arnold		I imagined some kind of initiation rite in old China, where every young man has to show his courage. They then receive a chopseal which is a mark of their courage.	Re: fuaburisu - The initiation rite in question is actually a reverse elbow chop to the brain, and you receive the chop seal if you have the power to withstand it. This initial imagery helps me with the altered chop seal and vertical placement.	<img src="勇.png">
通	traffic	traffic, pogo stick, chop-seal, hanko, utilise, utilize, road		I bounce down the road on my pogo stick, easily getting through the dense traffic. (Note: New primitive: chop-seal + utilize = pogo stick. Because a chop-seal is long and thin with a rubbery bit at the end. If it were big enough, you could utilize it as a pogo stick). [Edit: pogo stick also appears in 1409, 1690, 2530].	Building on gorgon´s story I now change mine to a much more silly and rememberable one. The Chinese police is using a helicopter to check and regulate the traffic. Hanging from the helicopter is a huge chopseal that they utilize to mark some of the cars that are causing trouble on the road.	<img src="通.png">
踊	jump	jump, wooden leg, mouth, stop, footprint, pogo stick, chop-seal, hanko, utilise, utilize		The winner of the long jump competition was disqualified when they found he used a pogo stick tied to his leg to jump further.	The high jumper has his wooden leg fitted with a pogo stick, and can now jump even higher. (See my note at traffic (#1408) for pogo stick). EDIT (2 years later): Keyword "jump" leads to confusion later on (see cjon256´s post), "Dancing" would be better (but be sure to keep it distinct from dance (#1774)). New Story: I was no good at dancing due to my wooden leg... until I had it fitted with a pogo stick!	<img src="踊.png">
疑	doubt	doubt, spoon, sitting on the ground, dart, drop, heavens, chop-seal, hanko, zoo, critters		(Katsuo) You come at the zoo entrance. ´Here sir, a spoon to feed the animals.´ cool ´and a dart(gun) in case stuff go wrong´ ....´ please chop-seal (sign) here for in case of accidents the zoo is not responsible.´ ´lion feeding time is. bla bla´ You are having serious doubts about if you still want to go into this zoo.	A very doubtful story: At the entrance to my local zoo they issue you with a special spoon (to feed the animals) and a dart gun (to defend yourself in case of animal attack). You must then hanko (seal) a document to say you’ve received both these items, only after which will they let you enter the zoo. (Oh, and if you forget your hanko, I doubt they’ll let you in).	<img src="疑.png">
擬	mimic	mimic, finger, fingers, doubt, spoon, sitting on the ground, dart, drop, heavens, chop-seal, hanko, zoo, critters		Ask a MIMIC to give an impression of DOUBT, and he will no DOUBT scratch his head with his FINGER.	I doubt you can mimic all these animals with just your fingers: http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Raymond+Crowe%22+Letterman (shadow puppets -- you´ll love it!).	<img src="擬.png">
凝	congeal	congeal, ice, doubt, spoon, sitting on the ground, dart, drop, heavens, chop-seal, hanko, zoo, critters		I doubt that the jello would congeal sitting on the counter, so I placed it in the icebox.	Is there any doubt that ice is congealed stuff?	<img src="凝.png">
範	pattern	pattern, bamboo, car, fingerprint		This pattern made of bamboo is for a new model of car designed to leave as small an ecological fingerprint as possible.	How about a serial killer who´s pattern is to drive by the victim and club them with a bamboo stick. Finally he makes a mistake and drops the bamboo stick, which is dusted for fingerprints.	<img src="範.png">
犯	crime	crime, pack of wild dogs, fingerprint		Crimes can often be solved using the tools of dogs and fingerprints.	This crime gang has yet to be caught because their pack of wild dogs takes care of licking off the fingerprints from all the crime scenes.	<img src="犯.png">
厄	unlucky	unlucky, cliff, fingerprint		Seeing some finger prints at the edge of a cliff, I wondered who that unlucky person was.	Sherlock Holmes is very unlucky: he just fell off a cliff while he was looking around for fingerprints.	<img src="厄.png">
危	dangerous	dangerous, bound up, unlucky, cliff, fingerprint		You´re bound up by ropes to an unlucky person. It´s dangerous, because whatever happens to him will happen to you too.	While rock climbing you are bound to the cliff by just your fingerprints, which is why it´s so dangerous.	<img src="危.png">
宛	address	address, house, mailbox, evening, fingerprint		Your address should be displayed on your house and mailbox.	For the primitive: This is a hi-tech Japanese mailbox, it automatically lights up in the evening, and has a biometric fingerprint scanner. --- Each house´s address, even if it´s hard to see in the evening, is like its own unique fingerprint.	<img src="宛.png">
腕	arm	arm, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, address, house, mailbox, evening, fingerprint	In Iraq people are having their addresses tattooed on their bodies, usually their arms, so they can be identified if they are killed. (true story)	Like in Memento, I tattoo my address on my forearm flesh so I don´t forget it.	In Iraq people are having their addresses tattooed on their bodies, usually their arms, so they can be identified if they are killed. (true story).	
怨	grudge	grudge, mailbox, evening, fingerprint, heart		I couldn´t drop my grudge against him. So I put a severed pig´s heart in his mailbox. He got the message.	I had a little grudge against my ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend...so I ripped out his heart (like in indiana jones and the temple of doom) and then I left it in her mailbox.	<img src="怨.png">
柳	willow	willow, tree, wood, blown eggs, sign of the hare, receipt, stamp		Having decided to use SIGN OF THE HARE rather than RECEIPT and STAMP my mnemonic goes as follows: The WILLOW is the TREE that droops likes a HARE´s ears.	A strange thing about the japanese willow tree is, it grows eggs... but the eggs have no yokes. weird eh?	<img src="柳.png">
卵	egg	egg, sign of the hare, receipt, stamp, drops		The Easter Bunny dropped an egg on my desk and got yolk all over my receipts and stamps.	The 卯sign of the hare (#2041) hides eggs in his ears for Easter...　RTK2:　ラン　卵巣　らんそう(ovary).	<img src="卵.png">
留	detain	detain, receipt, sword, dagger, rice field, brains		Got a receipt for that dagger, son? If not, we´re going to detain you and send you to work in the rice fields.	The use of RANSOM NOTE (think of a receipt with a dagger through it on a door) works great with DETAIN. Here the RANSOM NOTE says that the girl has been DETAINED in an undisclosed location. To get her back take the RANSOM to a empty FIELD.	<img src="留.png">
貿	trade	trade, receipt, sword, dagger, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight		There´s a buyback program where you can trade in your dagger for money. But it´s quite ineffective, since only registered dagger-owners with the original receipts can participate, and not criminals with illegally-purchased daggers.	The new RANSOM note (a receipt stuck to a door with a dagger) from DETAIN (1423) appears again (probably after you went to the field as instructed) now gives instruction to TRADE the victim for CURRENCY you were told to bring.	<img src="貿.png">
印	stamp	stamp, staples, stamp		Before sticky backs, they had to staple stamps to letters.	Aaaagh, this old stamp doesn´t stick! Okay I´ll just staple it.	<img src="印.png">
興	entertain	entertain, staples, same, monks, hood, one, mouth, tool, animal legs, eight		To me, this looks like a pictograph of a road leading to the big city (see the buildings?) where there are plenty of places to be entertained. Unfortunately in this city, every store is the same: staples. What tools! [ayoung24].	Photographically, this kanji simply looks like a set of two speakers (the staples primitives) between the sub-woofer (primitive for same) -- all this as a tool to entertain a group of drunks at a club.	<img src="興.png">
酒	sake	sake, water, water droplets, water pistol, whiskey bottle		Sake is just watered down whisky.	Sake is the generic term for alcohol (not just japanese rice wine). And a very popular alcoholic drink in Japan is whiskey and water.	<img src="酒.png">
酌	bartending	bartending, whiskey bottle, ladle		At the local pub, their bartending practises are unusual. They serve the whiskey by pouring it from a ladle, like one would from the punch bowl.	Ever seen the anime Bartender? Bartending isn´t just about bottles of whiskey, it´s about ladling out advice.	<img src="酌.png">
酷	cruel	cruel, whiskey bottle, revelation, cow, mouth		It´s cruel to pour alcohol down a cow´s mouth.	Offering whiskey to people to encourage them to make revelations is cruel.	<img src="酷.png">
酬	repay	repay, whiskey bottle, state, stream, drop, drop3		Imagine a different kind of tax refund - instead of money, the state repays you with whiskey.	Hint: bottle deposit refund - the state will repay the recycling deposit for each alcohol bottle returned.	<img src="酬.png">
酔	drunk	drunk, whiskey bottle, ninety, nine, baseball, ten, needle		God you´re drunk! How many whiskeys did you have? 9? 10?	Whiskey with 90 percent alcohol will get you drunk. I don´t care who you are.	<img src="酔.png">
配	distribute	distribute, whiskey bottle, snake, self		To DISTRIBUTE WHISKY during Prohibition you had to be as sneaky as a SNAKE.	In Japan, it´s rude to distribute the sake to your self before anybody else.	<img src="配.png">
酸	acid	acid, whiskey bottle, streetwalker, Ministry of silly walks, John Cleese, license, elbow, human legs, walking legs		The prostitute carries an old whiskey bottle filled with acid to throw at any difficult Johns.	Dealing alcohol requires a license, dealing acid requires fast legs (to run from the police).	<img src="酸.png">
猶	waver	furthermore, waver, pack of wild dogs, chieftain, Molotov cocktail, animal horns, whiskey bottle		The waver for this kanji means to hesitate. I wavered before going into the bar with a bunch of horned wild dogs drinking whiskey straight out of the bottle.	. Have you ever had Wild Dog brand whiskey? That stuff is downright evil. So evil, the bottle has horns, and you need to sign a waver before you drink it. Because of this warning you will surely waver as you bring the shot glass to your lips.	<img src="猶.png">
尊	revered	revered, chieftain, Molotov cocktail, animal horns, whiskey bottle, glue		I drank the Devil Whiskey and was revered by all. Too bad I had to have my anus glued shut from the damage it did to my digestive system...	Red Bull, the chieftain (#2906) is so revered in his clan that everyone sticks to him like glue.	<img src="尊.png">
豆	beans	beans, table, one, mouth		If I eat BEANS, after ONE MOUTHful I fart like some kind of HORNED ANIMAL.	I hate using primitives that are completely unrelated. Let´s call this one Mr. Bean! He´s an easy character to build stories with.	<img src="豆.png">
頭	head	head, beans, table, one, mouth, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight		The head of the family sits at the head of the table.	Mr Bean´s head.	<img src="頭.png">
短	short	short, dart, drop, heavens, beans, table, one, mouth		He´s so short, he can´t even throw over a table while playing darts.	Sort of like ping pong, this kanji represents a game where you throw darts over a table at your opponent. The serve is rarely returned, so the games tend to be short.------------ This character apparently refers to duration, not just to height.	<img src="短.png">
豊	bountiful	bountiful, bend, beans, table, one, mouth		The bountiful feast was so bountiful that it bent the table below it under its weight! いただきま〜す！.	Her bust and bum was so bountiful I couldn´t resist the urge to bend her over a nearby table and...	<img src="豊.png">
鼓	drum	drum, samurai, beans, table, one, mouth, branch, ten, needle, crotch		Japanese festivals have drums so big, a samurai has to SIT (not stand) on a table to beat one with a tree branch! http://www.d2.dion.ne.jp/~hidafyh/furukawayh/gyouji/image/maturi03.jpg.	I really hate the primitive meaning of "table" for "bean." I just use "bean." Anyways, for the DRUM primitive, imagine a SAMURAI who beats on a DRUM with two chopsticks, and a BEAN skewered on each end of the chopstick to produce a better sound. And the obvious story is: "DRUMing on a DRUM with a huge BRANCH".	<img src="鼓.png">
喜	rejoice	rejoice, drum, samurai, beans, table, one, mouth, mouth, mouth2		The samurai sitting on the drum is on a stage, and the people below him are rejoicing with their mouths in unison. It helps me to imagine the placement this way.	In the taiko (drum (#1444)) song of rejoicing, the drummers shout with open mouths.	<img src="喜.png">
樹	timber-trees	timber-trees, tree, wood, drum, samurai, beans, table, one, mouth, glue		The hippies object to trees being cut down for timber. They have glued themselves to the timber-trees and are beating their drums.	Everyone likes to see big trees fall down. For this kanji imagine hundreds of spectators glued to their chairs, then a drum roll and then a cry of "timber!!!" as the huge tree crashes to the ground.	<img src="樹.png">
皿	dish	dish		Three dishes stacked side-by-side in a dishwasher.	Pictograph of a dish with a three-layer cake slice on it.	<img src="皿.png">
血	blood	blood, drop, dish		Vampire orders blood in one of those posh restaurants. Imagine his shock when all he gets is a giant white bowl and just a single drop of blood in the centre and a drizzling of balsamic around the edge. Disgusted he calls the manager over tells him its overpriced tosh and bites into his neck with a huge gush of blood spraying everywhere.	Image: Holy Grail with a drop of Jesus blood on it.	<img src="血.png">
盆	basin	basin, part, eight, sword, dagger, dish		The part of the kitchen sink in which you wash dishes in is the basin.	Your mom yells at you to stop throwing dishes in the basin. She lifts up (to show primitive order) the broken parts to show you the damage you´ve done.	<img src="盆.png">
盟	alliance	alliance, bright, sun, day, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, dish		(re: Raichu) An undercover alliance between Japan (the sun on its flag) and Turkey (the moon on its flag) detected by a surveillance satellite dish. http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100126a3.html.	A new alliance is proclaimed at the end of a meal between officials. As a symbol of their alliance they clean up together one dish, and present it to the photographers. The clean dish under the flash lights appears very bright, and it´s pretty much all you can see on the photo that appears on the next morning´s newspapers, with the title "New alliance, one bright dish!".	<img src="盟.png">
盗	steal	steal, next, ice, lack, yawn, dish		You are so poor you dont know where your next dish will come from all you know is that you will have to steal it.	The first thing to steal is the silverware; next, the dishes.	<img src="盗.png">
温	warm	warm, water, water droplets, water pistol, sun, day, dish		If you leave water out in the sun in a dish, naturally it will get warm.	I ate the sun on a plate, and I now feel warm inside. I had to drink water to stop this burning.	<img src="温.png">
監	oversee	oversee, retainer, slave, reclining, lying down, one, floor, dish		The slavetrader oversees the slaves washing dishes int he kitchen. No reclining on the floor!

鑑	specimen	specimen, metal, gold, oversee, retainer, slave, reclining, lying down, one, floor, dish		The overseer tags his slaves with gold earrings, just like specimens.

猛	fierce	fierce, pack of wild dogs, child, dish		The fierce WILD DOG attacked the CHILD who came near his feeding DISH.	If you want to make your wild dogs fierce, feed them a child. Children are the holy grail of dogfood you know...	<img src="猛.png">

塩	salt	salt, soil, dirt, ground, reclining, lying down, mouth, dish		In the old days, salt was a worth alot, so it is not surprising to find someone reclining on the ground, mouth to plate, getting every last grain of that delicious salt.	Remember the mock sushi documentary that circulated a while ago: "Because some feel that the shoyu was not salty enough, complementary salt dishes are provided on the ground outside the sushiya, you can recline and put as much as you desire in your mouth".	<img src="塩.png">
銀	silver	silver, metal, gold, silver		Like gold, silver is a metal.	Not sure why Heisig find the right side so troublesome. My grandma´s hairpin (just before long (#1920)) is made of silver, the metal that best reflects sun light. I´m sure you can see the flash from her hair as she walks by on a sunny day. Note that the two elements (sun and hairpin) share not only a horizontal stroke, but also the left vertical one. Therefore a bit odd stroke order.	<img src="銀.png">
恨	resentment	regret, resentment, Freud, state of mind, silver		The athlete´s state of mind is nothing but resentment after getting the silver medal.	Data´s greatest resentment is getting a silver medal in Science Olympiad. (Image: Data fuming on the podium muttering about being half robot).	<img src="恨.png">
根	root	root, tree, wood, silver		Since trees eat through their roots, one could imagine roots as tree silverware.	The roots of the magical tree are silver.	<img src="根.png">

(Image: the strangely dresses islanders stirring a pot of brew. Careful fermentation (#1430)).

Here we have the "brew"-man, who brews some kind of whiskey using palm tree leaves. Instead of collecting them himself, he just buys the grass skirts from the people on this tropical island where he lives (which you may name the JOU island, after the chinese reading).	<img src="醸.png">

素	elementary	elementary, grow up, thread, spiderman		When he was growing up, Venom never had many friends in elementary school. Maybe it explains why he turned out how he did.

麦	barley	barley, grow up, walking legs		If you eat lots of barley, you´ll grow up to have strong walking legs.	Barley is a very cheap grain, and it´s not really worth spending time to harvest.

峰	summit	summit, mountain, Segway, Macbeth, walking legs, bushes		Walking legs over "bushes" needs to have a primitive meaning of its own. It appears in several kanji, such as 縫 sew (#1563), 逢 tryst (#2417), 蜂 bee (#2687), and 鋒 sword´s point (#2768), and it is clumsy to work bushes and walking legs into every story. "Pointy" works fairly well: the walking legs are stuck on top of the pointy part of the bush; and for this character: a summit is the pointy end of a mountain.	Moses climbs to the summit of the mountain using his walking legs to talk to the burning bush.	<img src="峰.png">
縫	sew	sew, thread, spiderman, tryst, Segway, Macbeth, walking legs, bushes, road		Good thing I brought some thread, cause I need to sew my pants that I tore up walking through the bushes (see summit (#1562)) before we hit the road to go back down the mountain.

To ensure longevity of her virginity, Alice applied a thick layer of glue on her bush.	<img src="寿.png">
籍	enroll	enroll, bamboo, christmas tree, wood, once upon a time, storyteller		Once upon a time, in order to enroll in a Christian school you had to answer a series of questions to ensure that you were really Christian.

Once upon a time, Santa Claus visited Asia and left presents under bamboo Christmas trees for all the children who enrolled in his Asian beta-testing...	<img src="籍.png">

謹	discreet	discreet, say, words, keitai, mouth, cabbage, flowers, mouth, grow up		Muttering words of gratitude for a wonderful meal, I discreetly slipped my cabbage under the table for the dog.	Cabbage primitive: When a cabbage is growing up, you must put it in your mouth before it flowers, because that´s when it becomes bitter. Seriously, it´s called ´bolting´ or something.

Simply splendid. Ten out of ten.´ The villager gruffly replies: ´No it ´aint. It´s all muck. An´ I´m gonna cut it all down and sell it to the farmer for silage.´.	Hint: Splendor in the Grass. Compare with 草. This is just a more splendid version of that kanji.	<img src="華.png">
垂	droop	droop, drop, silage, walking cane, stick, one, floor		For an old man with a walking stick, even a drop of silage to carry on his back will make him droop low down to the floor.

序	preface	preface, cave, beforehand		The preface to all human history was written beforehand in caves.	Rename the "beforehand" part to be glove (because you have to wear gloves beforehand if you want to wield the halberd, which is why this primitive is an incomplete halberd). The story: a winter morning. A textbook author is holed up in his tiny office, a veritable cave. He wants to start his masterpiece textbook by first writing the preface. But he can´t get started. He sits and stares at empty paper until evening. It gets cold and he puts on gloves, shivering, but still unable to start his preface.	<img src="序.png">

Our hero lets out a blood-curdling scream and tears his rake handle vertically in half, so he now has two wooden staffs (split rake handle) to fight with. He grips each staff (left side and right side) and rams it into the horns of the charging bulls. The force of each charging bull causes the tips of each staff to split again (split bottom of each rake handle).	You decide to take the bull by the horns and do both chores concurrently, grabbing your double-handled rake before attempting to clean up both your´s and your neighbours´ garden. But unfortunately, it´s not long until your rake splits in two.	<img src="兼.png">

腰	loins	loins, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, need, old west, woman		If you want to get closer to the actual meaning, then I think that 腰(こし) is more like the hips or the small of the back. After being sat down in the office too long, people often say 腰がいたい！It´s the part of the body that needs massaging.	To the puritans reading this site - please stop reporting stories that have anything to do with sex! Although (as wrightak said) this kanji really refers to the hips, Heisig clearly chose the keyword ´loins´ because it was anatomically close enough, and the primitives lent themselves to an easy-to-remember story. Just because you´re all sexually repressed doesn´t mean other people won´t benefit from a story such as "the part of the body people need more than any other are the loins".	<img src="腰.png">
票	ballot	ballot, old west, altar, show, two, small		In the Old West there were no ballot boxes. Afraid of fraud and fighting among the gunslingers, the ballots were posted into a slot in the top of the local church altar instead.

In western political elections (US), peoples ballots will often depend on religion and at which altar the prospective president prays.	<img src="票.png">

献	offering	offering, south, ten, needle, belt, happiness, ten, needle, stand up, vase, chihuahua, dog, large, drop, ten2, needle2		A South Korean street vendor is offering chihuahu snacks.	If you go to someones place and the food sucks, you lower it down south of the table as an offering to their dog.	<img src="献.png">
門	gates	gates		Heisig´s stroke order in the 4th edition (and earlier) is wrong, so be careful -- first is the left-most vertical stroke, then draw the rest of the "sun" attachment as you would normally. In fact, if you just wrote it out as two suns with elongated sides, you´ll get the stroke order exactly correct.	The gates to Hell. guarded by Cerebus or ... Bill Gates?	<img src="門.png">
問	question	question, gates, mouth		A mouth on the Gates of Hell says "Answer me these questions three, or thru the gates ye soon will be".	Hark! Who goes there? is the expected question from the mouth of the guard at the gate…　　　RTK2:　モン　質問　しつもん(question).	<img src="問.png">
閲	review	review, gates, devil, horns, elder brother, teenager, mouth, human legs		A little devil at the gates of hell reviews your record to see if you´re evil enough to get in.

簡	simplicity	simplicity, bamboo, interval, gates, sun, day		The simplicity of bamboo plant is in all its joints being at equal intervals.	[simplicity; brevity] The ししおどし is a bamboo device for scaring birds from the gates of your garden by clacking against a stone at regular intervals. Its design is simplicity itself. (Inspired by PepeSeco).	<img src="簡.png">
開	open	open, gates, two hands		Sure you can squeeze through these gates by kicking them or pushing them with your body, but if you want to get them wide open, you need to do that with both your hands.	To open the gate, use your both hands.	<img src="開.png">

閣	tower	tower, gates, each, walking legs, mouth		To keep this distinct from other kanji such as "watchtower" and "pagoda", I use the mnemonic "towering tower". -- In some old 8-bit kung-fu videogame, with a plot similar as Bruce Lee´s last, unfinished movie, the hero must break through a gate at each level of the towering tower, fighting with opponents using various styles of kung-fu until he meets the finale at the topmost level of the "towering tower".

(I had the same idea as Dingomick) I imagine some prankster who put a bucket full of water on top of the huge gates, so that it would fall on the king as he came through them. See the king now, between the gates, all wet, dripping drops of water.	<img src="潤.png">
欄	column	column, tree, wood, gates, east, tree, wood, sun, day, tree2, wood2		[column; handrail; blank; space] I think about oriental (eastern) Torii gates: they have two supporting columns made of wood.

闘	fight	fight, gates, beans, table, one, mouth, glue		During the saloon brawl, one guy got glued to a table and was tossed out through the saloon gates.

To keep the place a bit of a secert, they only have one gate.	Hint : the "godown" is like a warehouse, it´s on the docks and mostly in Asia. To make an image distinct from that of "warehouse" or "storehouse", etc, I picture the goods stored there, piled up on pallets really high, and thus they have to "godown" before they can be taken outside. The front of this godown is a "meeting of small gates", i.e. a row of gates through which goods come in and out. The mouth can be an opening somewhere in the back, or the top, where cranes lift down the goods.	<img src="倉.png">

Every time the prison officers come to take him they ask him to come to the door. The old man with a grin always answers "Which door?", looking at his painted door with a grin.

肝	liver	liver, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, dry, clothesline		Well you all know that the liver is the part of the body that would be quite grateful if you led a dry lifestyle (i.e. no alcohol).	The slaughterhouse prefers to ship dried liver to the supermarkets (can you imagine boxes soaked in blood on the truck that delivers them?). Imagine them lifting the slabs of flesh and hanging them on the clothesline to dry.	<img src="肝.png">
刊	publish	publish, dry, clothesline, sword, sabre, saber		The newspaper pages are hung on the clotheseline to dry and then cut down with a sabre to be published.	The newspaper pages are hung on the clotheseline to dry. This gives the government a chance to censor the news: they cut up unwanted stories with a sabre. Therefore, only state-approved stories are published.	<img src="刊.png">
汗	sweat	sweat, water, water droplets, water pistol, dry, clothesline		The way sweat is supposed to work: it gets your skin wet, and then as it evaporates/dries, it cools you off.	When you sweat your clothes become soaked with water, prompting you to hang them to dry on a clothesline.	<img src="汗.png">
軒	flats	flats, car, dry, clothesline		Flats in the city are crowded. You get a space for your car in front, and a clothesline out back. Nothing else.	Small flats (garages) for cars help keeping them dry.	<img src="軒.png">
岸	beach	beach, mountain, cliff, dry, clothesline		At the base of mountain cliffs, there is usually a beach. You often can see people lying there, drying off after a swim.	Three impossibilities for a beach: There cannot be a beach at the top of a mountain. There cannot be a beach on the top of a cliff. There cannot be a beach that is completely dry.	<img src="岸.png">
幹	tree trunk	tree trunk, mist, ten, needle, early, sun, day, umbrella, dry, clothesline, ten2, needle2		A fine mist is falling, and so everyone gathers around near the tree-trunk, effectively using the rest of the tree as an umbrella in order to keep dry.	By astridtops - In the rainy mist, Totoro is standing in front of a tree-trunk at the bus stop, under the umbrella he just received. Look at him smiling: even when the big drops fall, he remains dry! Great story...which I get to by thinking: tree-trunk->TT ->Tonari no Totoro. I also imagine Mickey Mouse is there too as the KUNyomi for this kanji is みき.	<img src="幹.png">
芋	potato	potato, flowers, potato		If your potatos are growing flowers and those little hooked roots, you should either buy less or eat them faster.	If your potatoes are growing flowers, you need to store them in a more dry place, like hanging them on hooks so they don´t accumulate moisture on the floor.	<img src="芋.png">
宇	eaves	eaves, house, potato		Under the eaves of the house the poor family has potate plants.	Very good image Erik. To help those who struggleded with this, the eaves of a house is usually the bit where you hang the roof gutter along, usually made of zinc or plastic and shaped as a half-pipe. It catches rain water, so it flows to a drain pipe instead of down onto people and windows. And in this family the potato plants grow along the eaves so the water pours down on them. They are poor. so no gutter.	<img src="宇.png">
余	too much	too much, umbrella, potato, small		You hang an umbrella upside-down on a hook of the scales and fill it with little potatoes. No luck: it weights too much.	This is the kanji for 「あまり Amari」, which means too little in negative sentences and too much in the rest (always with a negative sense). I take the liberty of using the symbol ">" (more than, another meaning!!) as the umbrella component, and using two (#2) and little (#105) for the potato primitive. So, this kanji either means "two much" (more than 2) or "two little". (thanks, Virtua_leaf and Thunderball!).	<img src="余.png">
除	exclude	exclude, pinnacle, parthenon, acropolis, scales, too much, umbrella, potato, small		To become a member of The Pinnacle, they test you on a scale. If you weigh too much, they exclude you.	You won´t make it unless you exclude something. The climb to the pinacle cannot be completed if you are carrying too much. You just have to decide what you can afford to exclude.	<img src="除.png">
徐	gradually	gradually, Nelson, column, going, line, scales, too much, umbrella, potato, small		You can´t expect weight loss to happen overnight. You should limit going to the scale to weigh yourself to once a day or once a week, in order to observe the anticipated weight loss gradually.	I set up a column chart next to my scales so I could record my weight gradually changing.	<img src="徐.png">
叙	confer	confer, scales, too much, umbrella, potato, small, crotch		Amazed at the weight of his crotch, they conferred every honor upon him. (Image: guy with his junk on a scale getting a medal pinned to his chest/around his neck/being knighted, etc.).	When you confer again 又, you confer too much 余!	<img src="叙.png">
途	route	route, scales, too much, umbrella, potato, small, road		On this route, all trucks have to check in at the scales before they can get on the road.	There are too many roads, so you need to plan a route.	<img src="途.png">

The constellation of libra (meaning " scales" in latin) is diagonal to the handle of the big dipper.	<img src="斜.png">
塗	paint	paint, water, water droplets, water pistol, scales, too much, umbrella, potato, small, soil, dirt, ground		If you add too much water to the paint it will drip onto the ground.	A true artisan mixes his own paint from water and soils on a scale in careful proportions.	<img src="塗.png">
束	bundle	bundle, Chaplin, tree, wood, mouth		Mnemonic: Bundle of joy. Here I see the proverbial stork with a baby hanging from its mouth fly straight into a tree. Painful, but he doesn´t drop the bundle.	Unlike in 杏, this big mouth isn´t content to wait for apricots to fall in his mouth, so he has climbed the tree and is taking them in bundles.	<img src="束.png">
頼	trust	trust, bundle, Chaplin, tree, wood, mouth, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight		We found a bundle of severed heads in your room, its difficult to trust you.

疎	alienate	alienate, zoo, critters, stop, footprint, bundle, Chaplin, tree, wood, mouth		[True story] In Osaka the homeless (the alienated) live in large numbers around the city zoo. Picture them in winter all bundled up in rags trying to keep warm, alienated from the society, living literally worst than the animals in the zoo who at least are bundled in their natural furs and have pens to live in sheltered from the elements.	This kanji is so strange that it was alienated at the kanji zoo. The bundle of joy stork bundles this kanji up and takes it to a kanji foster home.	<img src="疎.png">
速	quick	quick, bundle, Chaplin, tree, wood, mouth, road		If you find a bundle of money on the road, pick it up quick before anyone notices.	Uh oh. The stork just dropped the bundle of joy in the middle of the road. Somebody save it, quick!	<img src="速.png">
整	organize	organise, bundle, Chaplin, tree, wood, mouth, taskmaster, correct, one, ceiling, stop, footprint		Recycling in Japan, you have to make sure all your bundles are organized correctly otherwise the taskmasters won´t accept them.	When a bundle of taskmasters organize something chances are it won´t be done correctly because they are constantly arguing.	<img src="整.png">
剣	saber	sabre, saber, awl, fit, meeting, umbrella, mouth, person, sword, sabre, saber		If it helps, make the awl primitive ice pick instead. They´re basically the same thing. This kanji is an easy David vs. Goliath story of the icepick vs. the saber...	Every self-respecting ninja knows the story of "The Awl and the Sabre". According to the legend, a woman once defended herself by using an awl against a sabre! She used to work all day with that awl. However, the bandit using the sabre had no skill. And thus the awl beat the sabre. And from there the saying goes : "The sabre is powerless against the awl, if one can´t use the sabre.".	<img src="剣.png">
険	precipitous	precipitous, pinnacle, parthenon, acropolis, awl, fit, meeting, umbrella, mouth, person		The edge of The Pinnacle is precipitous, so they have a guard posted with an ice pick to poke people and keep them from the edge.	Well I have someone climbing an inflatable precipitous pinnacle. Once at the top it is so precipitous that the person is afraid to climb down and instead punctures the inflatable pinnacle with an awl to get safely and slowly back to the ground.	<img src="険.png">
検	examination	examination, tree, wood, awl, fit, meeting, umbrella, mouth, person		You´re giving a TREE an EXAMINATION. You take a wood sample from the TREE with an AWL (cmp exam (#1278)).	Don´t confuse with exam (#1278), test (#354), evaluate (#1487). Think of examination as a doctor´s examination. You´re having problems getting wood in bed. You go in for a doctor´s examination. The doctor shoves an icepick into your manhood as part of the examination.	<img src="検.png">
倹	frugal	frugal, person, awl, fit, meeting, umbrella, mouth, person, person2		Mr. T is as frugal as they come. He uses his one ice pick for everything: to eat, pick his teeth, clean his toilet, kill people, cook, etc.	The Dalai Lama is a very frugal monk and a fit person for being 73...　RTK2:　ケン　倹約　けんやく (economizing)...　　　　　　　　　　　　Pure Group:　剣1671　険1672　権1673　験1980.	<img src="倹.png">
重	heavy	heavy, thousand, computer, rice field, brains, soil, dirt, ground		The first computer in the world was as heavy as thousand computers are now.	To me it looks like a car with two extra wheels, like a truck. As it is a very heavy vehicle I suggest an image of a huge mining truck, like the yellow Liebherr T282B. Remember that the first "wheel" is a bit bent. http://www.primidi.com/2004/06/21.html.	<img src="重.png">
動	move	move, heavy, thousand, ri, computer, power, muscle, arnold		Even though the furniture is heavy, it´ll be easy to move with all the muscles that he has.	His MUSCLES are so HEAVY, he barely can move...thats ironic.	<img src="動.png">
勲	meritorious deed	meritorious deed, move, heavy, thousand, ri, computer, power, muscle, arnold, oven-fire, barbecue		A meritorious deed? Like moving a damsel in distress out of a fire, maybe.	Prometheus did a meritous deed for humanity by MOVING FIRE from the gods to us humans.	<img src="勲.png">
働	work	work, person, move, heavy, thousand, ri, computer, power, muscle, arnold		Mr. T´s real line of work is for a moving company.	Mr T, move. Mr Ts new exercise video called "Work it suckaz". Here is shouting "move it work it move work it!".	<img src="働.png">
種	species	species, wheat, cereal, heavy, thousand, ri, computer		After the whole low-carb craze, scientists developed a new low-carb species of wheat, so that dieters could eat it without getting heavier.

Naturally, they COLLIDE when they both turn in the same direction. (ty dingomick).	<img src="衝.png">
病	ill	ill, sickness, hospital, third class, one, ceiling, inside		Caveman got ill after flying third class. The cabin air and food got to him.

痴	stupid	stupid, sickness, hospital, know, dart, drop, heavens, mouth		Of course caveman is stupid. He doesn´t know anything. He´s a caveman!	This kanji shows stupidity as a "knowledge-sickness". Everybody can be stupid at times, and it usually happens because of a lack of experience. Hence the stupidity is a "knowledge sickness".	<img src="痴.png">
症	symptoms	symptoms, sickness, hospital, correct, one, ceiling, stop, footprint		Once you have all the symptoms right, you have correctly identified the sickness.	A sickness can only be correctly diagnosed if the symptoms are identified correctly.	<img src="症.png">
疾	rapidly	rapidly, sickness, hospital, dart, drop, heavens		I picture a sick caveman, and two people rapidly blowing darts at him. One is blowing poison darts, the other is blowing antidote darts. Will the sick caveman live or die? Depends on how rapidly they fire.	If shot with a poison dart, sickness develops rapidly.	<img src="疾.png">
痢	diarrhea	diarrhea, sickness, hospital, profit, wheat, cereal, sword, sabre, saber		For a country full of pay-per-use public toilets, sudden diarrhea is certainly the most profitable sickness!

疫	epidemic	epidemic, sickness, hospital, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch		Sickness-missiles are being engineered by bio-terrorists to spread epidemics all over the world. Imagine seeing footage of a place where those sickness-missiles are built : rows after rows of missiles, and if you look closely on each is inscribed in tiny letters the name of different sickness such as "flu", "plague", etc.	SICKNESS / MISSILE ** Hint: True fact about biochemical warfare: in the medieval and ancient world, SICKNESS in the form of the corpses of those who had died from some EPIDEMIC or plague were often hurled at the enemy via the crude MISSILE launchers of the time. [C].	<img src="疫.png">
痛	pain	pain, sickness, hospital, pogo stick, chop-seal, hanko, utilise, utilize		The CAVEMAN felt such a pain after his POGO STICK got stuck in his butt.

医	doctor	doctor, box, dart, drop, heavens	A doctor so confident at inserting cannulas that he does it with a dart and a box on his head	The doctor puts the cardboard box on his head and throws a dart at a chart to determine his patients´ illnesses.

匹	equal	equal, box, human legs		This kanji is used commonly as a counter for small animals. This is a pictograph of a SMALL ANIMAL´S view from inside a CARDBOARD BOX looking out at his masters HUMAN LEGS. He´s probably hiding so the master does not COUNT him with the other animals which will probably be eaten (thus he avoids everyones EQUAL fate on the farm: the kitchen table).	Imagine a magician doing that trick where he puts his assistant in a box and proceeds to saw her in half. Don’t the human legs sticking horizontally out of the box remind you of an equal sign?	<img src="匹.png">

When I was a kid I went out camping in a teepee. I ate beans for dinner, and afterwards I produced so much gas that my teepee actually ascended in the air!	<img src="登.png">
澄	lucidity	lucidity, water, water droplets, water pistol, ascend, teepee, wigwam, beans, table, one, mouth		Scuba divers know that when you ascend in the water, your lucidity increases (For non-divers, the deeper you go, the more you become mentally impaired by nitrogen narcosis, every 50 feet is like drinking one martini). Scuba divers also know that as you ascend in the water, the lucidity of the water improves, too.	A few drops of acid/peyote and the Indians obtain lucidity on their vision quest, as if they were floating in the lucid sky.	<img src="澄.png">
発	discharge	discharge, teepee, wigwam, two, human legs		I spent some time in her TEEPEE...just the TWO of us...but I looked between her HUMAN LEGS and I saw a nasty DISCHARGE...so I made my 出発　rather hastily.

As he sees that his colleague accept to do some extra work during the week-end and even sleep at the office, he says to them: "I pity da fool who work during week-end! You might as well install a pup tent in the office and forget about your home".	<img src="僚.png">
寮	dormitory	dormitory, house, pup tent, large, St. Bernard, sun, day, small, little		This guy would rather use his pup-tent as a house, than sleep in the dormitory. So he effectively turned that pup-tent into a house by getting a postal address for it etc. (just to emphasize house).	All-male dormitories in Japan are really weird, and tend to have a little too much 男気. Here is a trick they play where if they find that one dorm member has pitched a "pup tent" while sleeping, they make it into a house by putting a little roof on top of it -- complete with a lit cigarette for a chimney -- and wait for the "fun" to start (fun meaning...lighting their friend´s genitals on fire).	<img src="寮.png">

[Careful: mould (#680) which has two hands and soil/clay].	<img src="形.png">
影	shadow	shadow, scenery, sun, day, capital, tall, top hat, mouth, small, little, shape		The sun over the capital cast a shadow with the same shape.	Mystique the shape-shifter blends into the scenery by transforming into a form that looks like little more than an animated shadow.	<img src="影.png">

膨	swell	swell, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, drum, samurai, beans, table, one, mouth, shape		An injured body part may swell. It will begin to throb like a bass drum and will change shape.

珍	rare	rare, king, jewel, ball, parasol, umbrella, shape		The king has a really rare umbrella, it can change shape.	Tip: umbrella + shape : This combination of primitives appears four times in Heisig, so it may be worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest "parasol" (because it is the same shape as an umbrella). REF: rare (FRAME 1723) , check-up (#1724), measles (#2574), fallible (#2720).	<img src="珍.png">

済	finish	finish, water, water droplets, water pistol, adjust, adjusted, sentence, plaid, kilt, Billy Connolly, two, fenceposts, cabers		When the goalkeeper finishes the game, he drinks a lot of water and adjusts himself.	Finish him! Subzero adjusts the water in your body and crushes you into a few million pieces.	<img src="済.png">
粛	solemn	solemn, rake, fenceposts, cabers, rice		Even though it´s a maddening task, the monks stay solemn as they rake rice between the fenceposts.	Note: This is not sieve as it has a full rice and not rice grains and the hook is missing from rake. Also the given stroke order is incorrect (fenceposts should come last).	<img src="粛.png">
塁	bases	bases, rice field, brains, sparkler, soil, dirt, ground		Playing baseball in a rice field with sparklers stuck into the ground to act as bases.	The traditional New Year´s baseball game in Japan is held at midnight in a rice field. They stick sparklers in the ground for the bases so they can be seen, and to be more festive.	<img src="塁.png">
楽	music	music, white, dove, sparkler, tree, wood		Zelda: Ocarina of Time - The white sparkly thing is Navi. She´s hovering/dancing around a tree to the legendary Lost Woods music.

率	ratio	ratio, mysterious, question mark, top hat, cocoon, sparkler, ten, needle		It´s quite mysterious how each sparkler gives of sparkles at a precise ratio of ten to one. Physicists have been studying this effect for decades, known as the Sparkler Effect, and using it to explain why stars look like sparklers in the night sky.	Keep separate from proportion. Gandalf is trying to adjust the aspect ratio of his monitor from 4:3 to 16:9 so that he can watch Lord of the Rings in widescreen format. He´s poking around the inside of his monitor with a magnesium needle when he causes a short circuit which sets his needle on fire making the needle look just like a sparkler.	<img src="率.png">
渋	astringent	astringent, water, water droplets, water pistol, stop, footprint, sparkler		I think that Heisig meant this as the "slightly bitter but fresh" meaning that it can have to describe foods like lemons (しぶい). So imagine a guy trying a cocktail (water), feeling like he´s been kicked in the face (footprint) and sparks are flying from his tongue. ´How did it taste?´. ´Hmm, yes, slightly bitter, but fresh".	If you eat something astringent water will stop the sparkly sensation in your mouth.	<img src="渋.png">
摂	vicarious	vicarious, finger, fingers, ear, sparkler		Now that I´m a responsible adult, I have to get my vicarious thrills from watching stupid people put sparklers up to their ears and burn their fingers.

See here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Two.	<img src="映.png">
赤	red	red, soil, dirt, ground, sword, dagger, small		He was stabbed with a dagger, and little drops of red blood dropped onto the ground.

赦	pardon	pardon, red, taskmaster		The student blushed until his face was red, so the schoolmaster decided to pardon him.	There aren´t many pardons given by the Red taskmasters in China. 80% of the world´s death penalties are performed there...　　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　シャ　赦免　しゃめん(pardon).	<img src="赦.png">
変	unusual	unusual, apple, walking legs		It´s quite unusual and abnormal to see an apple with walking legs running away from the person who wants to eat it!

跡	tracks	tracks, wooden leg, mouth, stop, footprint, apple		Pirate pokes the tip of his wooden leg into an apple to disguise his tracks.	To hide his distinctive wood-leg tracks, this pirate is throwing apples after his tracks in order for animals to come and confuse his tracks.	<img src="跡.png">

湾	gulf	gulf, water, water droplets, water pistol, apple, bow		In his most daring feat, William tell used his bow to shoot an apple off the head of his son across the water of the gulf.	An army of archers must cross a gulf of water. Fortunately there are millions of apple trees growing in the cliffs above the gulf. The archers use their bows to shoot down apple after apple, which all fall into the water and slowly fill up the the gulf until the archer soliders can cross on foot.	<img src="湾.png">
黄	yellow	yellow, salad, sprout, shoot, animal legs, eight		The salad did not look very appetizing... The sprouts were yellow and there were animal legs sticking out of it.	I order a salad with sprouts. I´m asked if I´d like to add chicken. Yes please. My salad then arrives . . . . topped with these horribly gnarled yellow things. Chicken feet! (animal legs) ugh.	<img src="黄.png">
横	sideways	sideways, tree, wood, yellow, salad, sprout, shoot, animal legs, eight		A tree went all yellow. It died and fell down, ending up sideways.	In a horrible accident, a yellow schoolbus gets wrapped sideways around a tree.	<img src="横.png">
把	grasp	grasp, finger, fingers, mosaic		Japanese censorship laws require pornos to use a mosaic screen, so you can´t see what the porno chick is grasping with her fingers (but you can assume, neetch).	Your fingers grasp the Rubic´s cube... if only your brain could too.	<img src="把.png">
色	color	color, bound up, mosaic		Bound up in the Rubik´s cube are the 6 different colours.	Ever look closely at mosaics? They contain a bunch of images bound up into a larger one. It seems amazing until you realize that the only quality of the smaller images that really matters is their colour.	<img src="色.png">
絶	discontinue	discontinue, thread, spiderman, colour, color, bound up, mosaic		The Spider-man´s multi-colored tie-dye costume comic book series was discontinued after only one issue because of poor sales and fan protests.	Spiderman has decided to discontinue his red color suit in favor of the black one, it looks way cooler.	<img src="絶.png">
艶	glossy	glossy, bountiful, bend, beans, table, one, mouth, colour, color, bound up, mosaic		To print something with bountiful colour, they use glossy paper.	Glossy prints bring out bountiful colors more so than matte...　　　　　RTK2:　エン　艶聞　えんぶん(love affair).	<img src="艶.png">
肥	fertilizer	fertilizer, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, mosaic		PART OF YOUR BODY excretes something that is commonly used for FERTILIZER.

甘	sweet	sweet, wicker basket, picnic basket		Little red riding hood is carrying around a wicker basket filled with sweet baked cookies for granny.	Girls are kinda sweet and sexy until they reach their twenties. So 20 minus ONE.	<img src="甘.png">
紺	navy blue	navy blue, thread, spiderman, sweet, wicker basket, picnic basket		Thanks raulir - As many Japanese perverts know, navy blue threads conceal school girl sweetness underneath.	Much like Violet Beauregarde from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Spiderman failed to heed Willy Wonka´s warnings, and upon chewing on the 3 course meal chewing gum turned a very navy shade of navy blue.	<img src="紺.png">
某	so-and-so	so-and-so, sweet, wicker basket, picnic basket, tree, wood		I had the same idea as fuabrisu. A generic person is described here as having body sort of like a tree trunk and head sort of like a wicker basket.

You might hear the words of someone conspiring... "If you do so-and-so...".	<img src="謀.png">
欺	deceit	deceit, bushel basket, hamper, animal legs, eight, lack, yawn		Kasparov practices deceit by grabbing your rook while pretending to yawn.	Every day, a smuggler takes bushel baskets on donkeys across the border. But the border patrols can never arrest him for lack of evidence no matter how much they search the bushel baskets: they can´t find whatever he is smuggling. What was his deceit? He was smuggling donkeys!	<img src="欺.png">
棋	chess piece	chess piece, tree, wood, bushel basket, hamper, animal legs, eight		Chess piece = wooden rook.	Ever seen those huge chess games in parks? The large wooden chess pieces need to be carted in a shopping trolley.	<img src="棋.png">
旗	national flag	national flag, banner, compass, direction reclining, lying down, bushel basket, hamper, animal legs, eight		The United Republic of Chess´ national flag is actually a banner with a rook, that way they can hang it at every tournament.	The national flag of Croatia. It´s a banner with the Croatian coat of arms, commonly referred to as the Chessboard (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Croatia).	<img src="旗.png">
期	period	period, bushel basket, hamper, animal legs, eight, moon, month, flesh, part of the body		The slowest remote chess game ever: a one month period between every move.	The girl´s panties are all in the bushel basket as it´s that time of the month again... her period.	<img src="期.png">
基	fundamentals	fundamentals, bushel basket, hamper, animal legs, eight, soil, dirt, ground		Fundamentals of chess: use the rooks to protect your ground.	A Bushel-basket full of earth contains the fundementals of farming. i.e. earth.	<img src="基.png">
甚	tremendously	tremendously, bushel basket, hamper, equal, human legs		It´s a tremendous match between the two chess-players. They are clearly eachother´s equal.	These two bushel baskets are tremendously huge. But not only they are huge, they are also perfectly equal in size.	<img src="甚.png">
勘	intuition	intuition, tremendously, bushel basket, hamper, equal, human legs, power, muscle, arnold		Intuition is a tremendously powerful resource of the mind.	Using Zareon´s story for the previous frame "tremendously"... The two chessplayers who are eachother´s equals are so good at chess that they don´t have to even move a muscle. Their brain power does it for them. Furthermore, they don´t even have to think, really. Their intuition takes control. This is: extreme chess.	<img src="勘.png">
堪	withstand	withstand, soil, dirt, ground, tremendously, bushel basket, hamper, equal, human legs		Because I hid myself behind a huge dirt barrier I dug, I was able to withstand the tremendous nuclear blast.	Plain old soil can withstand tremendous amounts of pressure.	<img src="堪.png">
貴	precious	precious, Takanohana, purse, in, one, floor, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight		Frodo kept the precious in the purse but did a switch with some worthless shells when he went to sleep.

遣	dispatch	dispatch, purse, in, one, floor, maestro without baton, road		Dispatch all cars and chase the maestro! He´s gone crazy and stolen a ladies purse!	Apart from meaning DISPATCH, this kanji can mean "to give (to someone lower than you)," "to do," and to even "have intercourse." STORY: The MAESTRO is on the ROAD waiting for a pimp to DISPATCH some new ladies (lower than him) so that he can GIVE THEM money from his PURSE and then DO IT with them. Where is the MAESTRO´S baton? You don´t wanna know...	<img src="遣.png">
舞	dance	dance, reclining, lying down, tub, sunglasses, dancing legs, ballerina, evening		The yakuza boss reclines in the oaken bathtub wearing his shades while his personal harem dances nakes for him.	I learned nothingness (#1775) first because it is a very common kanji. Probably easier to think of this kanji in that context. Attractive dancers should dance wearing nothing but sunglasses.	<img src="舞.png">
無	nothingness	nothingness, reclining, lying down, tub, oven-fire, barbecue	In a hot tub you can relax and have your stress vanish into nothingness.	When I enter the wooden tub heated by flames in the onsen, I can let all my worries slip away and be submerged into nothingness.	In a hot tub you can relax and have your stress vanish into nothingness.	<img src="無.png">
組	association	association, thread, spiderman, shelf, my bookshelves		The leader of the Spiderman association has tons of Spiderman figurines lined up on his shelf.	Watch this: http://i146.photobucket.com/albums/r249/sith_lord10/updated%20showroom%20july/s29.jpg The leader of the Spiderman association has tons of Spiderman figurines lined up on his shelf.(Zactacular).	<img src="組.png">
粗	coarse	coarse, rice, shelf, my bookshelves		Refined rice [1535] can only be found in exclusive grocery shops. Coarse rice by contrast fills the supermarket shelves - don´t go looking for anything else there.	Ugh, why does this shelf feel so coarse? Because it´s made of rice, of coarse! Get it? Of coarse?? Hahahahahahahahahah god i hate my life.	<img src="粗.png">
租	tariff	tariff, wheat, cereal, shelf, my bookshelves		The EU and US impose such high tariffs on food imports that third world wheat (the most basic of staples) never reaches first world supermarket shelves.	According to Henshall, this kanji originally represented the harvested rice (the wheat primitive) that farmers paid as a tithe. Its meaning today would seem to be very similar. Imagine the farmer putting aside some of his harvested wheat on a shelf in order to pay the tariff to his lord.	<img src="租.png">
祖	ancestor	ancestor, altar, shelf, my bookshelves		The ancestor worship is so common in Daoist and buddhist countries that you can buy tiny altars to put on the shelves, one for each deceased family member.	The urns of ancestors are kept on shelves next to the altar.	<img src="祖.png">
阻	thwart	thwart, pinnacle, parthenon, acropolis, shelf, my bookshelves		In a last ditch effort to thwart the invaders of The Pinnacle, they push glass shelves over the edge onto their heads below.

査	investigate	investigate, tree, wood, shelf, my bookshelves		A whole team of cops is sent to investigate how a tree could grow on top of a shelf with no soil or water.	The result of the inverstigation of the missing Trees? Why, most of them had become shelfs!	<img src="査.png">
助	help	help, shelf, my bookshelves, power, muscle, arnold		HELP! Someone´s pinned under this bookshelf and it´s gonna take a lot of muscle to lift it off!	Can you help me move this shelf? I don´t have the muscle to do it alone.	<img src="助.png">
宜	best regards	best regards, house, shelf, my bookshelves		It seems like every time my Japanese friends send me their best regards, they accompany them with a gift. Over time, I´ve gotten so many that I had to buy a second house which contains nothing but several fancy shelves. Each shelf is dedicated to a certain friend of mine and contains every last one of their presents.	We have a shelf in our house where we put Christmas cards from people who send best regards for the holiday season...　　　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　ギ　便宜主義　べんぎしゅぎ(opportunism).	<img src="宜.png">
畳	tatami mat	tatami mat, rice field, brains, crown, shelf, my bookshelves		The king is peacefully sleeping on his new tatami mat when all of a sudden a shelf falls over and kills him. You can see his crown poking out and the brains splatter out the top of his head from all the pressure.	Making tatami mats from rice field waste was Japan´s crowning achievement, but for some reason other countries just shelved the idea.	<img src="畳.png">
並	row	row		This is a simplification of 竝, a ideogram of two people standing in a row.	Hint : as a primitive I use the image of a rowing boat. In a rowing boat people sit in rows, but also side-by-side (another meaning of the kanji), working together (yet another meaning of this kanji). Note : there will also be a kanji for "rowboat" coming at frame 1876. The rowing boat is associated with the sport, and is a primitive, while the kanji for "rowboat" has a generic meaning of "a small boat". In any case, the kanji for "rowboat" will not appear as a primitive in the book.	<img src="並.png">
普	universal	universal, row, sun, day		People at Universal Studios wait in rows so long that the sun goes down.	To me, row is way too close to file (#812), so I´m adopting Fab´s meaning of rowboat from the previous frame. Universal Studios went through a number of logo animations before settling on the one they are most famous for: the letters UNIVERSAL orbiting the Earth. One of the most ridiculous of these involved a man rowing himself in a boat around the sun.	<img src="普.png">
湿	damp	damp, water, water droplets, water pistol, sun, day, row		You first wash you clothes with water and wring them until they are just damp before hanging them in a row under the sun to dry. If you don´t wring them damp first they will take days to dry!	If your things are damp, lay them up in a row under the sun and let the water evaporate. (thx Raichu)...　RTK2:　シツ　湿気　しっけ(humidity).	<img src="湿.png">
顕	appear	appear, sun, day, row, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight		One day a row of Suns appeared in the sky, turning everyone´s heads upwards.	Clouds were covering the sky for months now. Rows upon rows of people spent whole days with their heads turned upwards, waiting for sun to appear.	<img src="顕.png">
繊	slender	slender, thread, spiderman, Thanksgiving, harvest festival, ten, needle, fiesta, row		Spiderman has to stay slender, so during thanksgiving, he keeps away from the long row of food.	At the time of Thanksgiving, there´s a row of all sorts of food on the table, which you mustn´t eat if you want to stay as slender as a thread.	<img src="繊.png">
霊	spirits	spirits, rain, weather, two, row		After raining for two days in a row, you plead with the SPIRITS for some relief. (Adapted from johnskb,21-5-2006).	When it rains, two worlds come together and spirits can be seen in the forest, dancing in a row.	<img src="霊.png">
業	profession	business, profession, upside down in a row, not yet, tree, wood		A truly gruesome profession: an abattoir worker. Where the carcasses are upside down in a row that have not yet been cut up into sausages and steaks.	The legal profession was turned upside down when Row vs. Wade determined that a fetus is not yet a human…　　　　　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　ギョウ　営業中　えいぎょうちゅう("Open for Business")　　　　　　　　　　ゴウ　宿業　　しゅくごう　　(accumulated karma).	<img src="業.png">
撲	slap	slap, finger, fingers, upside down in a row, husband		After a row husbands take their wives upsides down over the knee and slap them with their fingers on the bottom (if that doesn´t get me banned…).	Here we have badly behaving HUSBANDs, whose wives have had them hung UPSIDE DOWN IN A ROW. Each wife approaches her HUSBAND, berates him, gives him a sharp SLAP in the face and, Three-Stooges style, pokes him in the eyes with her FINGERS.	<img src="撲.png">
僕	me	me, person, upside down in a row, husband		Mr. T also finds himself as one of the HUSBANDs, whose wives have had them hung UPSIDE DOWN IN A ROW. But when his wife comes up to punish him, he pleads, “It’s ME, Baby. I wasn’t behaving badly like these other foo’s.”.	Building on johnskb: Although it goes against the Heisig method, this story is a lot easier to remember when you know it´s the kanji for "boku." Males usually use either "boku" or "ore" (instead of "watashi") to refer themselves. "Boku" is slightly boyish and soft; "ore" is rough & tough. Mr. T would definitely use "ore" -- but when he´s one of the husbands hung upside down in a row about to be punished by his wife, he puts on a sweet act and switches to "boku" when he pleads "come on baby, it´s ME!".	<img src="僕.png">
共	together	together, salad, animal legs, eight		The character for deluge (#1799) gave me the idea to use together as a primitive for Noah´s Ark. Noah kept plenty of salad on board to entice the animals with their animal legs to scurry on board together, two by two.	The conjoined twins, who are always together, have trouble eating together because one is a vegetarian, eating salad and the other is a avid meat eater, eating chicken legs.[Thanks fuaburisu!].	<img src="共.png">
供	submit	submit, person, strung together, salad, animal legs, eight	A person strung together in a net must submit in a fight	It took over 600 frames for Mr T to make (#1142), the Ark, but when he was finally done, he cast his saw aside and submitted the Ark to Noah for his approval. "I pity the foo who doesn´t climb aboard this ark," said Noah to his friend.	Mr. T submits a resume together with his application. "I pity da foo don´t got no resume!" he says.	<img src="供.png">
異	uncommon	uncommon, rice field, brains, strung together, salad, animal legs, eight		Noah´s Ark is so uncommonly large, he can even fit a rice field on top to feed the animals.	It´s uncommon to find a pair of together twins who are connected at the brain! When such a set does turn up, they are inevitably showcased on TV.	<img src="異.png">
翼	wing	wing, feathers, wings, uncommon, rice field, brains, strung together, salad, animal legs, eight		The thing about feathers is that they usually cover the entire bird. A creature with feathers only on its wings would be very uncommon.	WINGS without any FEATHERS would be an UNCOMMON site. Well, unless you like to eat chicken WINGS alot.	<img src="翼.png">
洪	deluge	deluge, water, water droplets, water pistol, strung together, salad, animal legs, eight		Water plus Noah´s Ark equals deluge.	Lots of water coming together is called a deluge.	<img src="洪.png">
港	harbor	harbor, deluge, water, water droplets, water pistol, scene, strung together, salad, animal legs, eight, snake, self		During a deluge, all the poor snakes get washed into the harbour.	All throughout the deluge Noah had been kicking himself for forgetting to bring any snakes onto the Ark. It wasn´t until the deluge had finished, and Noah had brought the Ark safely back to the harbour that he realised that the snakes had been under the Ark all along.	<img src="港.png">
暴	outburst	outburst, sun, day, strung together, salad, animal legs, eight, grains of rice		Having spent all day stringing together grains of rice he suddenly had an outburst, "I can take it any longer!".	Noah was having an outburst after being at sea for 40 days and 40 nights and running out of rice grains to eat. Then the sun suddenly burst out in an outburst over the Ark and there was an outburst of cheering.	<img src="暴.png">
爆	bomb	bomb, fire, outburst, strung together, salad, animal legs, eight, grains of rice		Actually means explosion, like an outburst of fire.	Bombs make fiery outbursts. It´s almost too logical, this one.	<img src="爆.png">
恭	respect	respect, strung together, salad, animal legs, eight, valentine		Noah feels like he gets no respect from the other passengers on the Ark, but they all make him Valentine´s Day cards to show how much they respect what he´s done for them.	If you wanna stay together you have to show your valentine respect.	<img src="恭.png">
選	elect	elect, southeast, snake, self, strung together, salad, animal legs, eight, road, snake2, self2		You´re driving on the road and you see two snakes together. You can´t avoid both, so you have to elect which one gets run over.	There were so many snakes on the road to Noah´s ark so they had to elect which two would represent the snake species.	<img src="選.png">
殿	Mr.	Mr, flag, strung together, salad, animal legs, eight, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch		Mr. President! We all stand here together under a national flag. One thing is certain: we´ll never give in. We are launching nuclear missiles now to implement mutually assured destruction protocol.	(+synewave) Noah looks on in disbelief as Mr. and Mrs. Smith board the Ark, start waving their flag everywhere and blasting everything in sight with a missile launcher.	<img src="殿.png">
井	well	well		I nearly died by falling in a well. Actually, on two separate occasions. I´m glad to see they´ve added these fence posts. Now the well will be much safer.

囲	surround	surround, pent in, well		The village surrounded the well with a wall so kids wouldn´t fall in.	You get good surround sound when your pent-up in well.	<img src="囲.png">
耕	till	till, christmas tree, well		If you just grow your christmas tree in a well, there will be no need to till the soil.	A man was tilling a new plot to plant xmas trees but his tractor hit an old covered-up well and fell halfway in, he´s asking for a new tractor for xmas..	<img src="耕.png">
悪	bad	bad, Asia, roman two, mouth, heart		Because Asian people started to eat Western food, their hearts became bad and they started having heart attacks.	Asian hearts are bad and evil. They invented so much martial arts: karate, judo, kungfu, muay thai, silat, etc... just to hurt each other. They torture their own people (China, North Korea). They torture other people (Japan in China and Korea). And they are able to hide all this behind their nice facade of kindness. Bad, bad Asians. (did i shatter some people´s ideas on Asia? my bad).	<img src="悪.png">
円	circle	circle, yen		The shape of a Yen coin.	A poor old man is almost killing himself trying to lift a huge glass hood with his cane (using it as a lever), to get to just one yen coin. Note : the kanji refers to a circular, round object, but also to the Japanese currency (pronounced "en").	<img src="円.png">
角	angle	angle, bound up, glass canopy, hood, walking cane, stick, two		A museum display of two walking sticks bound together under a glass canopy, showing the first device used to measure an angle.	The gates have been bound up together leaving no angle to get through...　RTK2:　カク　兎に角　とにかく(anyhow)　"horns on a rabbit".	<img src="角.png">
触	contact	contact, angle, bound up, glass canopy, hood, walking cane, stick, two, insect		For insects to get in contact with each other, they need to place their antennae at just the right angle.	Wow, he threw that BOOMERANG with such skill, it made CONTACT with that INSECT in mid flight.	<img src="触.png">
解	unravel	unravel, angle, bound up, glass canopy, hood, walking cane, stick, two, sword, dagger, cow		Did you know that you can unravel a cow? If you stick the dagger in at exactly the correct angle, the whole cow will just unravel.	Unravel the mystery by determining at what ANGLE the SWORD went into the COW.	<img src="解.png">
再	again	again, king, jewel, ball, belt		The king has eaten too much and has to get a new belt again. See his fat rolls hanging over?	This is a belt with a non-adjustable jeweled buckle. Everytime you go back to the leathersmith telling him to move the buckle because you´ve packed on a few pounds (but that this is the last time!), he says "Again?!? Weren´t you just here last month?".	<img src="再.png">
講	lecture	lecture, say, words, keitai, mouth, funnel, cone, celery, again		I have a funnel attached to my laptop that takes my prof´s lecture and puts the words into a text file. The bigger the funnel, the more accurate the conversion, so picture a bunch of laptops with large, unwieldy funnels attached to the USB port.	Image: a professor walking around with a funnel and simply pouring his words into each students head instead of a lecture. (Primitive: FUNNEL, who got the celery stuck in the funnel again?! You know it´s not supposed to be used for that!).	<img src="講.png">
購	subscription	subscription, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, funnel, cone, celery, again		Subscription is like a money funnel, because the receiving end is small (just one company) and the other end is wide (the whole country).

It´s very difficult to present a good argument if you don´t bring along a scrapbook with some key words jotted down to the meeting.	<img src="論.png">
倫	ethics	ethics, person, post-it note, meeting, scrapbook, glass canopy, hood, flowers		Mr. T talks about ethics at the academic conference.

偏	partial	partial, person, fishfinger, door, one, ceiling, flag, scrapbook, glass canopy, hood, flowers		Mr. T is very partial to hentai comic books. I know because he dropped a pile of them when I accidentally bumped into him at the door to kinokuniya!	Mr. T is partial to konbini hentai. He reads them for hours every day after work at his local konbini. (Primitive: KONBINI HENTAI, all the magazines(scrapbooks) by every konbini door in Japan).	<img src="偏.png">
遍	everywhere	everywhere, fishfinger, door, one, ceiling, flag, scrapbook, glass canopy, hood, flowers, road		Go down the road in Japan and you will find comics EVERYWHERE, newpaper stands, 7-11, Tsutaya, even the supermarket.

冊	tome	tome		Pictograph. I think of that Harry Potter spell book that had to be bound shut coz it wanted to eat you.	冊 さつ 1: counter for books A heavy scrapbook so full that flowers are sticking out. Only if a scrapbook is that full, it can be called a heavy book.	<img src="冊.png">
典	code	code, bend, tool		Coding is a tool which you can use to bend the computer to your will.	Think "codex" (mnemonic help) or "code of laws", or even Leonardo Da Vinci´s code. Here I see a codex as a tool used to bend the masses into submission. Picture a huge codex book lifted down on crowds to bend them down in submission. Another: if you bend to the code without asking questions, you are a tool!	<img src="典.png">
氏	family name	family name, drop, fishhook, fishhook2		Looks a bit like Ft => Family title => Family name.	The family name is important to me!

紙	paper	paper, thread, spiderman, family name		Spiderman doesn´t have a single paper with his family name on it (because he doesn´t want to reveal his identity).	I imagine a ridiculously expensive, and rather pointless, Japanese type of paper for writing letters, with one´s family name woven in fine thread somewhere in a corner.	<img src="紙.png">
婚	marriage	marriage, woman, dusk, family name, day		Marriage is the day in this woman´s life where she gets a new family name.	Tip: Heisig later introduces the kanji 昏 dusk (#2451).

抵	resist	resist, finger, fingers, calling card, family name, one, floor		Most japanese find it impossible to resist pushy businessmen in Japan when they push their damned business cards into your fingers.	Japan business etiquette tip: When someone hands you a business card, resist the impulse to fiddle around with it with your fingers, and by all means resist the urge to use the card to pick gunk from under your fingernails. Just examine it carefully, ask politely about the (few by now) kanji that you don´t know, and put it away carefully in a location that shows your counterparts how important they are to you.	<img src="抵.png">
底	bottom	bottom, cave, calling card, family name, one, floor		I put all those useless business cards at the bottom of a cave.	At the bottom of the cave you find a meishi: "LOST? DIAL 1-800-...".	<img src="底.png">

I managed to catch them with my fingers as the chopper was lifting off.	Dog tag: This is a wild animal track device. It has an arrowhead and screwdriver-shaped radio beacon. It´s evidently fired in animals to track their movements. When animal has a dog tag, it´s easy to catch it: just take a dog tag in your fingers.	<img src="捕.png">
浦	bay	bay, water, water droplets, water pistol, dog-tag, arrowhead, screwdriver, utilize, utilise		The water of the bay washes all the dog tags up after the battle.

舗	shop	shop, cottage, little-thatch, umbrella, earthenware jar, lidded crock, soil, dirt, ground, mouth, dog-tag, arrowhead, screwdriver, utilize, utilise		A shop in an impoverished country is just a cottage with a dog tag identifying it.	Normal cottages (舎 actually means a building) don´t have tags advertising their names, but shops do.	<img src="舗.png">
補	supplement	supplement, cloak, dog-tag, arrowhead, screwdriver, utilize, utilise		I usually hear supplement in "dietry supplement". So you´re given a cloak for extra fibre and dogtags for extra iron. Keeps you regular and stops you feeling tired and run-down.

郊	outskirts	outskirts, mingle, top hat, father, city walls		The city walls mark the outskirts of the inner city, where it begins to mingle with the suburbs.	The country folk and and the city folk mingle at the outskirts of town, just past the city walls.	<img src="郊.png">

廊	corridor	corridor, cave, son, halo, good, drop, silver, city walls		Your son plays in the corridor pretending he´s exploring a cave.	(ロウ) I think of the corridor found in the cave that Yoda made Luke Skywalker walk through as part of his Jedi training in Empire Strikes Back.

盾	shield	shield, drag, ten, needle, eye		This is a magic shield with ten eyes which have the power to drag the victim towards it.	From Wikipedia: "If a Spartan hoplite were to return to Sparta alive and without his shield, it was assumed that he threw his shield at the enemy in an effort to flee; an act punishable by death or banishment." Picture the enemy of a Spartan soldier poking his eyes out with a sewing needle and trying to steal his shield. However, the Spartan desperately clutches on, and is dragged around for a while, preferring to die than to lose his shield.	<img src="盾.png">
循	sequential	sequential, Nelson, column, going, line, shield, drag, ten, needle, eye		This is mostly used in the word 循環, "circulation" (of buses through their routes, of blood, etc). So I think of a column of little Roman soldiers with their shields marching sequentially through the veins of a person, as an anthropomorphization of the immune system.	A column of shielded soldiers advancing sequentially to avoid revealing the size of their army (Think "Sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers" from Star Wars).	<img src="循.png">
派	faction	faction, water, water droplets, water pistol, caveman, drag, person, rag		Drag + rag gave me trouble until I came up with zombie for it.

鍛	forge	forge, metal, gold, grade, staple gun, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch		As a discriminating metalsmith, I use the highest grade metals when forging such precision devices as staple guns and missiles.

The F word often comes out of the mouth of the empress.	<img src="后.png">
幻	phantasm	phantasm, cocoon, clothes hanger, coat hanger		After the play, The Phantasm of the Opera hangs up his cape on a clothes hanger and returns to his cocoon to sleep.

When you DOMESTICATE a animal, you are the DIRECTOR of it´s life and what it EATS.	<img src="飼.png">
舟	boat	boat		I see this kanji as a pictograph of a two story boat seen from the front. The glass canopy is the body of the boat. The drop on top is the chimney. The horizontal line is the ceiling/floor between the the 1st/2nd floor. Finally, the two drops in the middle are the lights on the decks.

盤	tray	tray, carrier, boat, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch, dish		What do you call a "CARRIER" of DISHes? A TRAY.	Imagine a restaurant set in Disney´s Fantasia or maybe in Harry Potter´s university, where dishes are magically landing and taking off of a carrier tray.	<img src="盤.png">
搬	conveyor	conveyor, finger, fingers, carrier, boat, cruise missile, missile, wind, crotch		When workers neglect workplace safety, their fingers get cut off and carried away by the conveyor belt, which looks like a ´finger carrier´ in that case.	During WWII, morse code was the primary means of communication from sea. The morse code specialist was the conveyor of messages to and from the crew of the carrier, using his fingers to tap out the secret messages. (This works especially well for 搬送周波数 carrier frequency and 搬送波 carrier wave, being the radio waves/frequencies used in morse code).	<img src="搬.png">
船	ship	ship, boat, gully, eight, mouth		A boy floats his toy boat in a gully and imagines it as an immense ship.	Aargh, hard to keep this separate from boat. How about this: the phrase "shape up or ship out!" This phrase originally meant that a soldier had better get his act together, or else face being shipped off into a combat zone. Here we see a poor WW-I soldier who has been shipped off to a combat zone. He´s riding in the boat overseas to fight in the trenches (gulley).	<img src="船.png">

繭	cocoon	cocoon, flowers, hood, stick, thread, spiderman, insect		This is a simple two-column manga showing the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a cocoon. First, the caterpillar gets under a large flower (bees tend to hang around flowers, which scare away other predators). Then, in the first frame, we see the caterpillar (insect). Then, a bar separating this frame from the next frame (remember that Japanese manga run the other way!), in which we see the insect covered with thread, making a beautiful cocoon.	The magic flower is the reason why Spider-Man ended up miniaturized and confined inside a hood-like cocoon together with an insect. Now, only a walking stick separates them both.	<img src="繭.png">
益	benefit	benefit, animal horns, one, floor, animal legs, eight, dish		The benefit of having sharp horns and fast legs is that an animal can get to the food dish first.

He later names it "hobby". REF: shrimp (#2689), haze (#2779).	<img src="暇.png">
敷	spread	spread, arrowhead, rice field, brains, compass, direction, taskmaster		Arrowheads are spread all over the field. The taskmaster profiteerer forces you to find them all using a compass.	Instead of being glued to one specialty (#46) 専, I decided to spread my attention in many directions 方, and be a taskmaster at none.	<img src="敷.png">
来	come	come, not yet, animal horns		You horny bastard, don´t come, at least not yet!	Here I see, of all things, Bambi. His animal horns have not yet come out.

沈	sink	sink, water, water droplets, water pistol, garter, crown, human legs		(thx geezer) The maimed waitress (no head and arms just her legs and trunk) is dropped into the water with a cement crown to make sure she sinks. She shouldn´t have been so nosy about her yakuza-boyfriend´s schemes.	This is the famous story of Archimedes and the Crown, where buoyancy was discovered. Watching the crown sink in the water, Archimedes detected the fraud and ran naked through the city (human legs distorted from running) yelling "Eureka! Eureka!" See http://math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/CrownIntro.html and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_%28word%29.	<img src="沈.png">

蒸	steam	steam, flowers, helping hand, complete, water, one, floor, oven-fire, barbecue		This kanji is used in compounds for the steaming of food and also for smoking/fumigation. Here we have the Japanese once again trying to replicate the French cuisine, only with a twist, steaming food with flowers (think of flower-smoked ham for example). Flowers must first be completely soaked in water, and then poured over a thin piece of flooring under which there is an oven fire.	Note: complete + water + floor are later combined into 丞 helping hand (#2919). Story: The driver of a steam train asks you for a helping hand and explains that your job is to throw flowers on the fire to make the steam.	<img src="蒸.png">

Then: The expedition to the poles is bad for your health, and the decay that started in your mouth spreads to your crotch – at which point you fall to the floor.	(modified Katsuo) Can simplify this using decay (#1243). You travel to the poles, a frozen wasteland. In desperate need of food you try to set up a snare but the tree is decayed (see story for decay (#1243)) so you catch no prey. The brutal cold first attacks your mouth as your lips turn blue, then your crotch also gets cold as your body fails; finally you fall to the floor.	<img src="極.png">

雅	gracious	gracious, tusk, turkey		Goodness gracious! Such an elegant turkey with a tusk. This mnemonic is meant to join RtK´s keyword with a better proposition. Heisig could have used "elegant" here, which is not confounded so easily with graceful (#721), and accurately represents the character´s meaning (it is also the chosen keyword in Kodansha´s Kanji Learner´s Dictionary).	To not confuse it with grace (#606) or graceful (#721), think of the phrase "Goodness gracious." Like: "Goodness gracious! A turkey with tusks!".	<img src="雅.png">
釈	explanation	explanation, animal tracks, drop, rice, shaku-hachi, flag, stick		Mrs. Badger follows the animal tracks to the den where she finds her husband getting a blowjob from a fox. "I have a good explanation for this. Really!".	Animal track primitive: As expected, animal tracks were left in place of the trail of rice I´d purposely dropped the night before. EDIT - also try the footprint for a primitive meaning, the classic symbol of detective films. STORY: This shakuhachi player is so talented, he can do interpretations of animal noises too. They´re so realistic he soon has animal tracks leading straight to wherever he´s playing.	<img src="釈.png">
番	turn	turn, dice, animal tracks, drop, rice, rice field, brains		The famers take it in turns to watch out for any animal tracks on their rice field.	They take turns alternating between wheat and rice in this field…　　RTK2:　バン　電話番号　でんわばんごう(telephone number).	<img src="番.png">

毛	fur	fur		I´ve heard of people having hair on the back of their hands, but this is ridiculous! That´s not hair, that´s fur!	Be careful not to pet a cat the wrong way - most cats don´t like you rubbing your hand backwards over their fur.	<img src="毛.png">
耗	decrease	decrease, christmas tree, fur		The amount of "fur" (needles) on a Christmas tree decreases, until it doesn´t look all that good.	Real fur coats and real christmas trees are dereasing the last couple of years. Plasctic chrismas trees and fake fur it is nowadays.	<img src="耗.png">
尾	tail	tail, flag, fur		A dog waves its furry tail like a flag.	A FLAG of FUR is a TAIL.	<img src="尾.png">
宅	home	home, house, lock of hair		This kanji is, of course, pronounced "taku", and it seems the owner of this home is a little bit otaku himself. He has hung up locks of hair suruptitiously obtained from various females all over his house. A veritable hair fetishist, and certainly someone whose home you wouldn´t want to visit.	Home is where the hair is.	<img src="宅.png">
託	consign	consign, say, words, keitai, mouth, lock of hair		When you consign a matter to someone, you get their word and a lock of their hair (to be used in a voodoo ritual if they don´t keep their word).	In "The Lord of the Rings", Galadriel consigned a lock of her hair to Gimli the dwarf, along with some wise words.	<img src="託.png">
為	do	do, so, strange building, tail feathers		In this kanji, you can see 3 katakana characters: ソ, ユ, and then ユ again followed by TAIL FEATHERS. STORY: "So (ソ) you (ユ) wanna DO it?" "Only if you (ユ) do" says the female bird as she raises her TAIL FEATHERS.	Do me from behind, says the bird, as she shakes her tailfeathers.	<img src="為.png">
偽	falsehood	falsehood, person, do, so, strange building, tail feathers		Mr. T doesn’t "DO" FALSEHOOD. It goes against everything he stands for. “I pity da foos who revel in FALSEHOODs!”.	It depends on what your definition of do, uh, is, says Mr. T giving falsehood about his affair with a peacock.	<img src="偽.png">
長	long	long, hair, hairpin, safety-pin		The Geisha with long hair uses an ornate lacquered hairpin to bundle it all up.	The top of this one reminds me of the staple primitive. So here´s my story: The girl´s hair was so long that she had to use staples instead of hairpins. It worked, but stapling her hair to her head was kinda painful.	<img src="長.png">
張	lengthen	lengthen, bow, long		The longbow is follows the design of a standard bow, only it has been lengthened.	Legolas recieves spam telling him that his can lengthen his "bow"...he smirks...he know´s it´s already long enough.	<img src="張.png">

喪	miss	miss, soil, dirt, ground, mouth, hairpin, safety-pin, mouth2		I miss my parents dearly. Here they lay, under a big cross, their mouths side by side. I stick hairpins in their graves. CAREFUL: the stroke order/primitive order is: ten, L mouth, R mouth, hairpin. "Soil" is not drawn in its stroke order.	This kanji means miss as in "miss a (dearly departed) person", not as in "miss a target".　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Here the dearly departed has been buried in the ground, with her favourite hairpin in place of a gravestone, and two mourners stand around crying with open mouths.	<img src="喪.png">
巣	nest	nest, owl, fruit, rice field, brains, tree, wood		Owls only nest in fruit trees.	The wise old OWL makes her nest out of FRUIT, carving out the middle for her chicks, because then it´s less work: no running back & forth to get food!	<img src="巣.png">

It´s a simple party, but someone invited people from the wrong gangs and the simple fiesta turns into an all-out turf war.	<img src="戦.png">
弾	bullet	bullet, bow, simple, owl, rice field, brains, ten, needle		Hunting with a bow is too complicated. I´m switching to something simpler--using a bullet.	The bow was a weapon for simple times, but nowadays it has been replaced by bullets.	<img src="弾.png">
桜	cherry tree	cherry tree, tree, wood, owl, woman		I was taking a picture of my girlfriend under the cherry tree during 花見, when an owl happened to poop on her at the exact moment the shutter snapped. It´s really my favorite picture , just don´t tell her that.	The tree in Japan that represents both wisdom (the owl) and femininity (the woman). This is a sakura (さくら), or cherry tree.	<img src="桜.png">
獣	animal	animal, owl, rice field, brains, one, mouth, chihuahua, dog, large, drop		The owl looks for its prey in the rice field. It sees so many potential animals to eat but since it only has one mouth, it decides that the tasty looking chihuahua will be its meal for tonight. (adapted from Copycatken,1-9-2006).	I have a strange story for this one but it works. I imagine a owl getting into a rice field which serves as a boxing ring. His opponent is a little chihuahua. The fight starts, the owl takes one punch to the mouth and is out cold. In the chihuahua´s corner is that coach from Rocky saying "Your an ANIMAL!!". A vivid image of this story works pretty well for me.	<img src="獣.png">
脳	brain	brain, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, owl, villain, sheaf, shovel		The brain is the part of the body that an owl will use to defeat the villain.	The brain is the part of the body that can give you the wisdom of the owl... or the wickedness of the villain.	<img src="脳.png">

This cliff is quite famous for daring individuals to cliff dive off of, but is any of them daring enough to threaten the owl?	The daring mouse gets a stern look after he climbs onto the owl´s cliff...　RTK2:　ゲン　厳禁　　げんきん　("Strickly Prohibited!")　　　　　　　　　　　ゴン　華厳経　けごんギョウ(Avatamsaka Sutra).	<img src="厳.png">

The owl was asked to raise his hand if he needed anything, but he had a wing, not a hand! So he made a tool that looked like a hand which he used when he needed to raise his hand. For raiseing, owl has a tool hand.	<img src="挙.png">
誉	reputation	reputation, owl, tool, say, words, keitai, mouth		This owl´s reputation skyrocketed after he created a tool in order to speak human words.	By word of mouth, owl-luring tool (raise (#1938)) gained a reputation of amazingly effective and reliable device.	<img src="誉.png">
猟	game hunting	game hunting, pack of wild dogs, anemometer, owl, wind, cornstalk		[game-hunting; shooting; game; bag] According to unicode.org and wwwjdic, 鼡 and 鼠 (mouse (#2065)) are variants. So, for 鼡 (which I´ll call rat) I have: an owl, flying in the wind, can easily spot a rat even if it´s hiding in the cornstalks. Now 猟 is easy: wild dogs are having fun by game-hunting rats.	The WILD DOGS are GAME HUNTING the OWL who flies like the WIND through the CORN STORKS.	<img src="猟.png">
鳥	bird	bird, white, dove, one, tail feathers		There is only one bird with such beautiful white tail feathers: the albino peakcock.	The BIRD let loose a WHITE ONE from it´s TAIL FEATHERS...right on my new car!	<img src="鳥.png">
鳴	chirp	chirp, mouth, bird		A chirp is quite simply the sound that comes from the mouth of birds.	This kanji is not limited to the chirp of a bird, but stands for the sound of any kind of animal. Picture a very weird bird that can imitate with its mouth (a bird with mouth, heh) the voice of many different animals: Meeow! Woof! Mooo! Cuack!!! (Maybe the bird has Kirby powers and obtains the abilities of the animals it eats).	<img src="鳴.png">
鶴	crane	crane, turkey house, bird		The original version of the "Ugly Duckling" was about a crane who grew up in a turkey coop. All the other birds made fun of it for not having a wattle or a snood or fanning its tail...	Do you know how cranes came to be? Well, they used to keep the poor bird cooped all the time. But the crane really wanted to be free, so it would always streatch its head and neck out of the coop trying to be free.	<img src="鶴.png">
鳩	pigeon	pigeon, nine, baseball, bird		Feed one pigeon and nine more birds will be swarming you immediately…　RTK2:　On list of rare or no official Chinese reading.	Imagine some pigeons going to see a baseball game. They would surely be the only birds there!	<img src="鳩.png">
鶏	chicken	chicken, claw, vulture, husband, bird		The vulture´s husband is a chicken...heck...who am I to judge their interspecies love? They´re both birds so its cool.	A continuation of mountain stream (#840) (which happens to have the same chinese pronunciation) : the husband who was saved by the great eagle says to his wife that from now on, they will eat chicken ! No more fishing hardships and falling in the water.. just raising birds. Every now and then the great eagle comes to visit and the man offers one of his chicken to the great eagle who had saved his life.	<img src="鶏.png">
島	island	island, bird, mountain		This island is the home of the terrible mythical bird Roc. It sits mighty atop the mountain waiting for the next hapless ship to pass by.

暖	warmth	warmth, sun, day, migrating ducks, claw, vulture, one, friend		Ducks migrate south for the winter... they follow the warmth of the sun.	A massive group of migrating ducks is blocking the warmth of the sun as they pass over your house/barbecue/picnic. Their formation is so humongous they block the warmth for a good 10 minutes while they pass over. Mnemonic for the migrating ducks primitive : the migrating ducks stick together like the best of friends, flying together as one (fifth stroke), they are not easy prey for the great eagles / vultures.	<img src="暖.png">
援	abet	abet, finger, fingers, migrating ducks, claw, vulture, one, friend		You abet the escape of migrating ducks by pointing them the way.	Aiding and abetting: You are accuse of abetting a drug dealer, by smuggling drugs in migrating ducks. Of course, this means you have to stick your fingers in their mouths.	<img src="援.png">
緩	slacken	slacken, thread, spiderman, migrating ducks, claw, vulture, one, friend		Oh no Spiderman has some migrating ducks stuck in his web, he has to slacken it so they can get out.	Spiderman is a slacken off. He lays around all day in the park watching migrating ducks...　RTK2:　カン　緩和　かんわ(mitigation).	<img src="緩.png">
属	belong	belong, flag, gnats, drop, insect, belt		These bugs BELONG TO an extremist group promoting insect independence. They are parading the FLAG of their group, the Nationalist GNATS, and wearing explosives BELTS for their planned terrorist war.	[WARNING: violent story] Two teams of insects are playing “capture the flag” (ala Unreal Tournament). All of them wear ammunition belts. Here you try to take the flag of the opponent team, when you are faced by an insect: “You’ll get our flag over my dead body!”. You reply: “All your base are BELONG to us!”, shoot him on the head, take the flag and run away. See the drop of blood flowing from his head?	<img src="属.png">
嘱	entrust	entrust, mouth, belong, flag, gnats, drop, insect, belt		The commando gnats entrusted their mouths to the translators and what came out was "All your base are belong to us!".	If you entrust me with something, my mouth belongs to you.	<img src="嘱.png">
偶	accidentally	accidentally, person, talking cricket, brains, insect, belt		Mr. T accidentially stepped on Jiminy Cricket (a brainy insect, with a belt sort of sash to hold his "conscience" badge).	Mr. T accidentally steps on Jiminy Cricket. // Primitive: right side: Talking cricket = Jiminy Cricket, a brainy insect with a belt to whip little kids who misbehave.	<img src="偶.png">
遇	interview	interview, talking cricket, brains, insect, belt, road		I was finally able to score an interview with the wisest being around: Jiminy Cricket. However, his schedule is really packed, so they had to squeeze me in while his tour bus rode between gigs. In fact, it was really short---after a few miles I was kicked out of the bus and stranded in the middle of the interstate. But man, it was worth it!	On the road to my interview I accidentally bump into Jiminy Cricket who gives me some good advice.	<img src="遇.png">
愚	foolish	foolish, talking cricket, brains, insect, belt, heart		Don´t be foolish! says Jiminy Cricket as he lashes you with his belt. Follow logic, like me, not your heart.	I simply imagine Jiminy Cricket jumping all over the place, like a mad man, yelling "yeeeeehaaaaa!". Maybe he just fell in love? Mnemonic - "Jiminy Cricket has a foolish heart".	<img src="愚.png">
隅	corner	corner, pinnacle, parthenon, acropolis, talking cricket, brains, insect, belt		Jiminy Cricket has a favorite corner he likes to slip into at The Pinnacle for a long drink.	Oh how the pious fall from their lofty pinnacles! Jiminy Cricket now deals drugs on the street corner.	<img src="隅.png">
逆	inverted	inverted, mountain goat, horns, mountain, road		There´s a road that´s been inverted- it´s gone from horizontal to directly vertical! The only beast that could possibly climb it is a mountain goat of course.	This reminds me of a cartoon I saw once, perhaps it was with Donald Duck. he is startled and furious when he chases this mountain billygoat further and further up the mountain road, untill the angle is so steep that he finds himself inverted. And falls down, while the goat stands solidly placed inverted and laughs a goaty laughter as Donald plumments and makes that typical Donald shaped cartoon crater at the bottom.	<img src="逆.png">
岡	Mount	mount, glass canopy, hood, mountain goat, horns, mountain		White mount , Fuji mount , olympus mount whatever ....The choice is yours but wherever you go they sell those snowglobe souvenir : under a GLASS HOOD you can see the mount with a MOUTAIN GOAT standing on top of it .... So kitsch you just can´t forget it .	This has the same meaning as 丘, so my "Mount" is a hill with mountain goats on it under a glass canopy. It´s obviously an effort by the locals to add some Mount atmosphere to their hill. As a primitive, it has the meaning "sturdy" (really), which Heisig has not used for some reason, but I will. The glass canopy must be pretty sturdy to keep the goats inside (bulletproof glass, I´m sure).	<img src="岡.png">
鋼	steel	steel, metal, gold, mount		Mount Fuji is completely made up of a metal known as steel.	Ancient shamans predicted a time when there would be Mounts made of metal. The steel skyscrapers of today…　　　　　　　　RTK2: 　コウ　鋼鉄　こうてつ(steel)…　Semi-Pure Group:　綱1963　(ｺﾞｳ): 剛1964.	<img src="鋼.png">
綱	hawser	hawser, thread, spiderman, mount		Spiderman saves Japan from floating away by tying Mt. Fuji to mainland Asia using a hawser made of web.	A sturdy thread is equally obviously hawser (heavy rope). (see previous frame).	<img src="綱.png">
缶	tin can	tin can, noon, sign of the horse, shovel		Horses kept in the mountains have a unique savory taste. At least so the text on this tin can would have us believe, which contains 100% authentic mountain horse.	The starving horse, stranded on the mountain, is forced to eat a tasty tin can.	<img src="缶.png">
揺	swing	swing, finger, fingers, condor, claw, vulture, king, mountain		I keep swinging gleefuly on the talons of the soaring condor until he slices off my fingers and sends me plummeting.	For the condor primitive: A condor is like a vulture, but twice as big and it lives near mountains (a suitable place for such a majestic bird). For swing: I´m sitting on a swing when a condor comes by and picks up the whole swing set with its big finger-like claws and now I´m swinging in mid-air. Weeeeeeeee!!!!!	<img src="揺.png">
就	concerning	concerning, capital, tall, top hat, mouth, small, little, understandably, chihuahua with one human leg		In the capital they have been having hearings concerning bioethics and bioengineering they call as their first witness a chihuahua with one human leg.	Ahem...CONCERNING your recent science fair project, it was a CAPITAL idea, but the CHIHUAHUA with a HUMAN LEG is freaking out the other contestants!	<img src="就.png">
懇	sociable	sociable, skunk, silver, heart		The skunk here is Pepe LePew of Looney Tunes fame. He´s a very sociable skunk, as far as skunks go, but instead of having a "heart of gold" he has a heart of silver (since he always finishes second in the game of love).	The skunk here is Pepe LePew of Looney Tunes fame. He´s a very sociable skunk, as far as skunks go, but instead of having a "heart of gold" he has a heart of silver.	<img src="懇.png">
免	excuse	excuse, village stocks, rabbit, bound up, human legs		Obviously this is the rabbit from Alice, excusing himself and rushing away on his legs, as he has a binding day schedule. This is at the same time an image, with bound=ears, day=head and legs are just legs. The image is used in rabbit (#2093).	What is the rabbit´s excuse for being such a jerk? Well he was bound up for a whole day while being stepped on by peoples human legs in some make-up labratory. Yeah I think I can excuse him after knowing that.	<img src="免.png">
逸	elude	deviate, elude, village stocks, rabbit, bound up, human legs, road		Tip : as a primitive rabbit becomes Bugs Bunny of Looney Tunes fame. Here Bugs Bunny eludes Elmer Fudd the hunter, once again.	Bugs Bunny eludes Elmer Fudd by pretending to be roadkill.	<img src="逸.png">
晩	nightfall	nightfall, sun, day, village stocks, rabbit, bound up, human legs	At nightfall, the sun is bound up on its side  and walked to bed	At nightfall the sun excuses itself and goes to sleep.	Imagine Bugs Bunny halfway sticking out of a rabbit hole, somewhere in Japan, taking in the sun, when all of a sudden, night falls. Our "sun-loving rabbit" burrows his way into the earth and pops out on the other side of the planet (say somewhere in America) and there it is, the sun high and bright in the sky! Thus, whenever it is nightfall you can be sure our "sun-loving rabbit" is taking in the sun somewhere else accross the globe.	
勉	exertion	exertion, village stocks, rabbit, bound up, human legs, power, muscle, arnold	The bunny's muscles help in times of exertion	Notice how BUGS BUNNY´s legs (hint about stroke extension) are starting to get big MUSCLES? It must be because he´s always EXERTING himself on the run from Elmer Fudd (or from kicking the shit out of Elmer Fudd when he catches up!!).	Hint: Energizer bunny.	<img src="勉.png">
象	elephant	elephant, colour, color, bound up, sow, pig		An elephant has huge ears, like a rabbit, and a big, fat body, like a sow.	An animal with huge ears like a rabbit, and a body fat like a pig... ¡An ELEPHANT! For the "phenomenon" connotation you could use Dumbo, or Joseph Merrick (the "elephant man") ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Merrick ).	<img src="象.png">
像	statue	statue, person, elephant, colour, color, bound up, sow, pig		The statue of liberty is being replaced by a statue of Mr. T riding an elephant.	In India, you see a lot of statues of the Hindu god Ganesha. Easy to recognize: he´s the person with the elephant head.	<img src="像.png">
馬	horse	horse, team of horses		Turkey with the drops at the top removed and tail feathers added (this matches stroke order and there are the tail feathers already, why not have the whole bird). If you take the two drops of 隹 as wings, then horses are like turkeys, but have no wings and have more prominent tail "feathers". Both are actually supposed to be pictographs, though.	The top part is half a comb (see frame 1920) with an extra vertical stroke to account for a sturdier version used to comb a horse mane. As a primitive I used the theme of the Trojan Horse. Not the modern computer viruses, but the large wooden horse which led to the demise of Troy and of the Trojans. Either its size (much greater than a live horse), or the fact that it conceals things into its belly, will set it appart from the horse primitive that came in frame 568 ("noon").	<img src="馬.png">
駒	pony	pony, team of horses, phrase, bound up, mouth		The cute little innocent-looking plastic pony on the desk of a student is in fact a trojan horse, hiding phrases in its belly which are used for cheating during an exam. No pony will be permitted on desks during tests!	A particular My Little Pony has a string that when you pull it, it repeats the same dumb phrase like "I love you".	<img src="駒.png">
験	verification	verification, team of horses, awl, fit, meeting, umbrella, mouth, person		We just verification that there are indeed no soldiers in the belly of this trojan horse. We´re just gonna stab it in the belly with this awl to check.	The verification proves the horse is real by poking it with an ice pick.	<img src="験.png">
騎	equestrian	equestrian, team of horses, strange, large, St. Bernard, street, nail, spike, mouth		If the equestrian team used trojan horses, it would be really strange.	Equestrian events are where you get horses to do strange things.	<img src="騎.png">
駐	parking	stop-over, parking, team of horses, candlestick, lord, drop, king, jewel, ball		Parking in the dark may be difficult...specially if you´re parking a trojan horse. To lend you a tiny bit of help, take this candlestick with you, and at least you´ll have some light.	In the olden days parking lots used to have reserved spaces for where the lord (of the set of houses, shops, whatever) could park his team of horses. nowadays it´s pretty much the same...reserved parking in front for the big bosses´ cars....	<img src="駐.png">
駆	drive	drive, team of horses, ward, box, sheaf		You have to be craaazzzzyy to drive a buggy led by a team of horses through a ward of Tokyo!	Wolverine drives his box by having a horse drag him around. He seems to really be losing it after coming to the homeless ward...	<img src="駆.png">
駅	station	station, team of horses, shaku-hachi, flag, stick		This reminds me of those infamous Mexican porn movies in which shakuhachi is performed on a horse. Here the deed is being done at a train station. As the passengers get off, so does the horse.	Anyone living in Japan knows that train stations play little melodies when the train is about to arrive. In Ye Olden Days, when horses and carriages were used for transport, the carriage driver would play a little melody on his shakuhachi to let the passengers know the carriage was arriving at the next station.	<img src="駅.png">
騒	boisterous	boisterous, team of horses, crotch, insect		The hidden Greeks inside the Trojan Horse are getting boisterous as one of them is bitten in the crotch by a nasty insect. If they don´t shut up, the Trojans will hear them...	Or more precisely: the team of horses are getting boisterous because one of them got bitten in the crotch by a horse fly. The kanji also means to roar, make up noise, to kick up a fuss and to make merry. Perhaps it is exactly the etymology behind this kanji.	<img src="騒.png">
駄	burdensome	burdensome, team of horses, plump, large, St. Bernard, drop		The Greek warriors inside the Trojan Horse are complaining about this burdensome plump warrior who is not helping at all (say, just eating candies and watching). - "You know you´re such a burden!". Note : be sure to keep "plump" distinct from the primitive meaning of "round" ("fat man").	If a passenger is too plump and heavy, its too burdensome for the horse.	<img src="駄.png">
驚	wonder	wonder, awe, flowers, phrase, bound up, mouth, taskmaster, team of horses		You stand in AWE at the 8th WONDER of the world, a huge TROJAN HORSE.	This is another word for surprise. 驚く＝おどろく= surprise. The Trojans stood in awe of the magnificent Trojan Horse that they thought was a gift. But imagine their surprise (wonder) when a bunch of Greeks came rushing out of it! (To further cement the connection between the primitives, if needed: It´s a wonder that the Trojans managed to speak keigo 敬語 even then, saying "わたくしたちを殺さないでください!!お願い致します!!").	<img src="驚.png">
騰	inflation	inflation, edam, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, quarter, team of horses		Every quarter moon, the cost of a trojan horse rises one quarter by inflation.	Flesh+quarter=McDonald´s quarter pounder. Due to inflation, McDonald´s has had to start making quarter pounders out of horse meat.	<img src="騰.png">
虎	tiger	tiger, magic wand, augury, cliff, hook, diced, seven, human legs		Magic wand + first two strokes of pelt (皮) + diced + human legs. A wizard who turns people he doesn´t like into newts with his magic wand goes for variety - he has always wanted a tiger pelt - but things go awry when the tiger promptly dices and eats him, leaving only a pair of legs. (a fitting end for a wicked wizard).	Tigger, the tiger, (from Pooh stories) is happy to have found a magic wand. Using it he can bounce up to a the top of a cliff, seven times as high as some human legs could bounce. Tigger thinks "Its great to be a tiger!	<img src="虎.png">
虜	captive	captive, tiger, male, rice field, brains, power, muscle, arnold		Captive men are thrown to the tigers. I think you can imagine something else is done to captive women...	Tip: To avoid confusing keyword captive with captured (#1018) note that captive contains "ti" for tiger.	<img src="虜.png">
膚	skin	skin, tiger, stomach, rice field, brains, moon, month, flesh, part of the body		Ending up in a tiger´s stomach is not good for your skin, as it´s full of stomach acids.	TIGGER only has visible SKIN on his STOMACH. The rest of his body is covered in orange fur.	<img src="膚.png">
虚	void	void, tiger, row		In Japanese folklore there is no hell, but there is the void. There, a row of tigers waits in the blackness to devour those souls who have failed in their spiritual life.	Warning to Sigfreid and Roy: Your entertainment contract will be null and void unless you can make all the tigers stand in a row.	<img src="虚.png">
戯	frolic	frolic, void, tiger, row, fiesta		This is a story about the end of the universe. The universe is turning into a featureless void. There´s nothing we can do about it except for throw a fiesta and frolic a little bit before it´s all over.	Sigfreid and Roy´s contract having been voided, the tiger is free to frolic about at the fiesta.	<img src="戯.png">
慮	prudence	prudence, tiger, think, rice field, brains, heart		Real meaning: "to ponder". You have to think with prudence (ponder carefully) about approaching a tiger, as is evident from 虎.	You have to think with prudence about approaching a tiger. If not, it will eat your brains and heart. Thanks raulir.	<img src="慮.png">
劇	drama	drama, tiger, sow, pig, sword, sabre, saber		A great Indian drama acted out every year is how a poor Bengali boy fended off the tigers from his pigs using only a sabre.	If you thought "The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe" was full of drama then you´ll love "The Tiger the Sow and the Sword".	<img src="劇.png">
虐	tyrannize	tyrannize, tiger, one, box		Here we see the evil tyrannizing tiger. What is on his chest? A giant E, for EVIL, of course.	The "E" shape actually means claws here, and the real etymology is a tiger tyrannizing other animals with its claws (the etymologies actually make sense once in a blue moon!). I think of the claws here as two hooks, representing the front paws. (stroke order of that part: 二＋last of 直).	<img src="虐.png">
鹿	deer	deer, cave, antlers, compare, spoon, sitting on the ground, spoon2, sitting on the ground2		Bambi wanders into a cave and sees a side order of salad and 2 spoons...but what´s the main course?	Santa´s reindeer, Rudolf, opens a nightclub in a cave. It´s popular with all the deer and reindeer in the world. The cave speciality is a salad w/ dressing on the side. There is no other deer club that can compare. How many other deer nightclubs are there?	<img src="鹿.png">
薦	recommend	recommend, flowers, deer, cave, antlers, slingshot, catapult, tail feathers		Picture an ad in which Uncle Jimbo (of "South Park" fame) recommends the latest craze in deer hunting : a high tech slingshot! The ad begins with Bambi prancing around, smelling the flowers. Then, all of a sudden, Bambi is brutally murdered with the slingshot, put on the cooking fire, and the camera pans to Uncle Jimbo happily munching on crispy cooked Bambi! Note: the slingshot is strokes 11-12.	It is recommended that deers stick to eating flowers. If they try to eat birds, they may end up choking on them, like this one here. Note that the head (白) is gone and the visible part of the body which is normally written with a stroke of the head must by necessity be drawn with a stroke of the tail.	<img src="薦.png">
麗	lovely	lovely, one, ceiling, mediocre, deer, cave, antlers, compare, ceiling2, mediocre2, compare2		The anthropologist made an exact deer painting from the cave ceiling on the ceiling of his house. Too bad they´re both mediocre. All his wife could say was, "How...lovely.".	Lovely bambi.... pictographe : just take a look at those innocent open eyes (part 1 it´s not more far fetched than seeing mediocre in it) with thin eyebrows what a lovely deer ...(part 2).	<img src="麗.png">
熊	bear	bear, ability, elbow, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, spoon, sitting on the ground, oven-fire, barbecue, spoon2, sitting on the ground2		Most don´t know it, but bears have the ability to walk on fire. They´re invincible creatures!	Note : I don´t know why James Heisig put "bear" ahead of "ability" (next frame), but I sugget to skip this, learn the next kanji ("ability") then go back here and use ability as a primitive.	<img src="熊.png">
能	ability	ability, elbow, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, spoon, sitting on the ground, spoon2, sitting on the ground2		The amputee has no hands but only stumps of flesh beneath his elbows. To give him the ability to eat he has two spoons implanted in his arm stumps, one in each side.	Kid from the Oracle´s place in the Matrix (whose head is shining like the moon) is holding a a spoon and making it bend using his special ability. When Neo asks to learn this ability the child replies, " Remember the truth Neo, there is no spoon." Neo Proceeds to the kitchen pondering these words of wisdom. The Child smiles mischeviously and pulls a second spoon hidden up his sleeve in the crook of his elbow. "That´s right Neo," the child laughs, "there is no spoon...there are two spoons!".	<img src="能.png">
態	attitude	attitude, ability, elbow, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, spoon, sitting on the ground, heart, spoon2, sitting on the ground2		This guy has an attitude problem – lots of ability, but his heart´s not in it.	Having a good attitude means believing in your heart that you have the ability to do anything - like memorizing more than 2000 kanji, for example.	<img src="態.png">
寅	sign of the tiger	sign of the tiger, house, caterpillar, one, ceiling, sprout, shoot, animal legs, eight		If you draw the sign of the tiger on the ceiling of your house, you will sprout tiger´s legs (animal legs) and be able to run and pounce like the big cats yourself.	The sign of the tiger is that he´s eaten all of the yellow (#1750) salad in the house.	<img src="寅.png">
演	performance	performance, water, water droplets, water pistol, sign of the tiger, house, caterpillar, one, ceiling, sprout, shoot, animal legs, eight		That was some great performance! He caused the water to shoot up into the air and form the sign of the tiger in airborne droplets. You sure missed a great performance!	I remember seeing advertisements growing up with the sign of the tiger saying to "Put a tiger in your tank", meaning that it would increase the performance of the drops of gasoline you put in.	<img src="演.png">
辰	sign of the dragon	sign of the dragon, cliff, two, hairpin, safety-pin		Bruce Lee is such a badass he climbed a sheer vertical cliff using only 2 hairpins.	The kid said "I don´t believe you! Dragons don´t exist!" so we made a little surprise for him: we pinned a huge dragon (it was just a sign really) on a nearby cliff. "Whoaaa! Dragon!" the kid said. "But why won´t it move?" "I tell you why, cause it´s pinned there with two hairpins" I thought to myself.	<img src="辰.png">
辱	embarrass	embarrass, sign of the dragon, cliff, two, hairpin, safety-pin, glue		During the shooting of one of his first movies in China, Bruce Lee fell through the cheaply built movie set, and into a barrel of glue. As you can imagine, to put Bruce Lee in that position must have caused great embarass to the chinese producer. Note the hints in the story for the position of the primitives.	Bruce Lee is embarrassed when he does a high kick and splits his pants. He has to glue them back together.	<img src="辱.png">
震	quake	quake, rain, weather, sign of the dragon, cliff, two, hairpin, safety-pin		Bruce Lee has magical abilities in his newest movie. He can conjure rain and earthquakes.	A la Kung Fu Hustle, Bruce Lee descends from the storm and causes an earthquake by smashing the ground.	<img src="震.png">
振	shake	shake, finger, fingers, sign of the dragon, cliff, two, hairpin, safety-pin		Bruce Lee shakes the confidence of his opponents by simply waving his fingers in front of them, they know that each of them is a deadly weapon in their own right. Hwwaaaa...	Your fingers will be crushed if you shake hands with Bruce Lee.	<img src="振.png">
娠	with child	with child, woman, sign of the dragon, cliff, two, hairpin, safety-pin		Any woman spending a night with the virile Bruce Lee is bound to end up with child.	BRUCE LEE´S WOMAN was WITH CHILD and it really upset her stomach because little Brandon Lee was kicking ass from the inside.	<img src="娠.png">
唇	lips	lips, sign of the dragon, cliff, two, hairpin, safety-pin, mouth		I love Bruce Lee dubbing. His lips move, but sometimes words don´t come out of his mouth.	Bruce Lee says "Read my lips...", but when I try to, his mouth isn´t moving with the dialogue.	<img src="唇.png">
農	agriculture	agriculture, bend, sign of the dragon, cliff, two, hairpin, safety-pin		The most unlikely persons in the world to take up agriculture must be Bender and Bruce Lee. An awkwared moment as they stare on the various farming utensils, hoe, plow. Both with straw hats on and blue overalls, and drawn in Groenigs irrevent style.	Bruce Lee is tough. But so is agricultural work. If Bruce took it up, even he would hurt his back from all the bending.	<img src="農.png">
濃	concentrated	concentrated, water, water droplets, water pistol, agriculture, bend, sign of the dragon, cliff, two, hairpin, safety-pin		The agriculture of Florida is concentrated on making concentrated orange juice. Just add water! Imagine a can of FCOJ, dumping it into a pitcher and adding water.	Concentrated water is going to revolutionize the agriculture! Just add water... oh wait...	<img src="濃.png">
送	send off	escort, send off, golden calf, horns, heavens, road		After worshipping the golden calf, God sent the Jews on a long road through the wilderness.	The problem with the "gold calf" primitive is that the first vertical stroke of "heavenly" is shorter than the second stroke. But as we know, "heavenly" clearly has the FIRST stroke longer, not the second. The primitives we really have here are "animal horns (first 3 strokes)" and "big/dog (last 3 strokes)." What are the BIGGEST ANIMAL HORNS that you can think of? For me its a MASTODON. STORY: In caveman times, you SENT OFF packages with the MASTODON express.	<img src="送.png">
関	connection	connection, gates, golden calf, horns, heavens		The golden calf is sent to the gates of Hell for it´s connection to false idols.	There´s a weird connection between worshipping the golden calf and visiting the gates of Hell.	<img src="関.png">
咲	blossom	blossom, mouth, golden calf, horns, heavens		Evil blossoms from the mouths of those who worship the golden calf. (Playing it safe and avoiding the image of a flower completely).	Blossom is an elegant euphemism for the precise part of the golden maiko that commands such a price in gold when she is ´deflowered´. (Along the lines of ´jade pillar´ and ´lotus flower´ in certain Asian texts.) [See my 2016-2018 for this sad tale.].	<img src="咲.png">
鬼	ghost	ghost, oni, drop, brains, rice field, human legs, elbow		A ghost, or oni, wandering slowly on its human legs, searching for brains to eat. What looks like an elbow here is actually a pictoral representation of the forked tail protruding out of its rear.	Ghosts aren´t very intelligent - they have but a drop of brains - so can´t tell the difference between an elbow and a pair of human legs.	<img src="鬼.png">
醜	ugly	ugly, whiskey bottle, ghost, oni, drop, brains, rice field, human legs, elbow		The ugly oni can´t get a date so he drinks sake by himself at the bar.	Drinking too much whisky can make you as ugly as an oni.	<img src="醜.png">
魂	soul	soul, rising cloud, two, elbow, wall, ghost, oni, drop, brains, rice field, human legs, elbow, elbow2		When we die, our soul rises up in a ghostlike rising cloud of mist up to heaven (we hope) (Adapted from darg_sama,28-10-2005).	When you die, your SOUL either goes to the RISING CLOUDS (heaven) or to the ONI (hell, the devil).	<img src="魂.png">
魔	witch	witch, hemp, cliff, grove, tree, wood, ghost, oni, drop, brains, rice field, human legs, elbow, tree2, wood2		The witch sold me some hemp that made me see ghosts don´t do drugs.	This modern version of the witch lives in some hippie community. She smokes a lot of hemp, and spends the day talking to ghosts, which not surprisingly appears only to her.	<img src="魔.png">
魅	fascination	fascination, ghost, oni, drop, brains, rice field, human legs, elbow, not yet, one, tree, wood		Ghosts have not yet left the world, they must still have a deep fascination with their past life on Earth.	Here the "Ghostbusters" founder talks about his fascination for ghosts (picture Dan Arkroyd in the movie if that helps). He says he has a fascination for ghosts ever since he saw one as a teenager. Since then he´s been scouring all of the world, trying to capture them on tape, on video... A journalist asks "When will it end ? Aren´t you tired of chasing ghosts ?" "Oh no, not yet ! Not until I become a ghost myself anyway !".	<img src="魅.png">
塊	clod	clod, soil, dirt, ground, ghost, oni, drop, brains, rice field, human legs, elbow		Without any weapons, our only defense was to throw clods of dirt at the advancing zombie horde.	Easy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem (or if you prefer, http://schwicky.net/xfiles/episodes/4/kaddish/).	<img src="塊.png">
襲	attack	attack, old dragon, vase, stand up, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, slingshot, catapult, snake, self, three, cloth, clothes, clothing, garment, dragon*		The top 16 strokes are the chinese radical for "dragon". Joining up both meanings of the radical we can name the top part of this kanji "imperial dragon". Two-headed snakes do exist as biological curiosities, and they look a bit like a slingshot (with the heads splitting at a junction). Our imperial dragon here, the pet of a Chinese emperor, is a rare "three-headed slingshot-snake" kept in a vase and fed with meat. When the emperor attacked neighbours, his army wore the imperial dragon garment.	You attack an old dragon 龍 and take his clothes. REF: dragon [old] (#2981).	<img src="襲.png">
嚇	upbraid	menacing, upbraid, mouth, incandescent, red, red2		To upbraid someone, you criticize them in a menacing way. In other words, you jaw at them with your MOUTH until both sides of their face turn RED (hence the double-red).	Tip: Heisig later names 赫 "red + red" as incandescent (#2908). Story: "So the boss upbraided you, huh?". "Yep, his mouth was incandescent.	<img src="嚇.png">
雰	atmosphere	atmosphere, rain, weather, part		(This is atmosphere as in ambiance, mood). Rain is only part of the atmosphere for a romantic porch date. Food, music, and candles are the rest.	The part of the sky that is responsible for weather and rain is known as the atmosphere. It only occupies part of the sky though.	<img src="雰.png">
箇	item	item, bamboo, harden, pent in, old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth		You´ve entered in a chinese shop where apparently the only item in sale is old, dusty, hardened bamboo (for construction for example). It looks like these items have been there forever. Asking the clerk if anything else is available, he doesn´t understand and instead asks - "Two items? Three items?" (the kanji is a counter for items) - thinking you want to buy something.	Dragon Quest - You find a hardened bamboo stick, perfect for a weapon, but you can´t pick it up because your items are full.	<img src="箇.png">
錬	tempering	tempering, metal, gold, east, tree, wood, sun, day		Tempering should be done with the metal facing east. (If not, the metal may pick up the earth´s magnetic field).	In the East, especially Japan ...there are masters of tempering metal to great strength....on the Spring of Trivia show in Japan I saw how a Japanese sword ...actually split flying bullets...all because of special Eastern tempering techniques.	<img src="錬.png">
且	moreover	moreover, shelf, my bookshelves		Moreover is a literary term to shelve what you had just been talking about, to come back to it later.	Same as darg_sama. Play on words. I imagine visiting someone who has an impressive collection of medals and trophies (chess champion, for example). After spending an hour showing you all the trophies in the glass shelf, you think "Whew! It´s over." ... but the person says "... and wait, there´s "moreover" !", pointing at more trophies lined atop the glass shelf.	<img src="且.png">
藻	seaweed	seaweed, flowers, water, water droplets, water pistol, furniture, goods, mouth, tree, wood, mouth3		Let wooden goods = furniture. Then: Walking along the sea shore you see some washed-up furniture with water (waves) splashing against it. From a distance it looks like flowers are growing out the top, but as you get closer you see it is in fact seaweed.	Take seaweed (water + flower) and hang it to dry in a tree to produce nori goods.	<img src="藻.png">
隷	slave	slave, samurai, altar, show, two, small, sieve, rake, grains of rice		The samurai sits on the altar and watches the slave rake rice all day.	The samurai from goodwill (#1097) maintains his good mood on his wedding day. He tells his slave that he can keep all rice (used for confetti) that he rakes up after the ceremony. Generous Man!!	<img src="隷.png">
癒	healing	healing, sickness, hospital, in the nick of time, meeting of butchers, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, sword, sabre, saber, heart		At the butcher´s meeting, all the butcher´s who have a heart disease attend the faith healing workshop.	Note: meeting of butchers + heart are later combined into 愈 in the nick of time (#2433). Story: For healing to take place, you must catch the sickness in the nick of time.	<img src="癒.png">
潟	lagoon	lagoon, water, water droplets, water pistol, mortar, tail feathers		Right part: mortar bound up over oven fire, comprising boiling cauldron. Lagoon is a shallow pond, thus easily warmed by sun, large-scale equivalent of a boiling cauldron.	I stapled both sides of some tail feathers to a waterfall towering over the lagoon to give it a more tropical feel…　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　RTK2:　On list of rare or no official Chinese reading.	<img src="潟.png">
丑	sign of the cow	sign of the cow, dagger, two		Pictograph of a stanchion, which includes two vertical posts to restrain cows so they can be milked, with a horizontal stroke showing the number of cows per stanchion: one. A stanchion is a great symbol for the SIGN OF THE COW, since modern, domesticated cows are often stanchioned in barns.	77 cows behind a fence.	<img src="丑.png">
卯	sign of the hare	sign of the hare, blown eggs		You know how missing childrens´ pictures often appear on milk cartons? Well here we have a missing hare. His concerned family is having his picture printed on the backs of receipts and even on stamps. So far, however, there has been no SIGN OF THE HARE.	rabbit ears.	<img src="卯.png">
巳 THE END!!!!	sign of the snake	sign of the snake, mosaic with bit missing		Haha! If you are reading this then I beat you. You went too slow, browsed the forum too long, or stayed out too late with your Japanese girl/boyfriend, whilst I, Kanji Master (you may call me ´sir´), sat alone in my room with a leaky pen and a clawed grip. All your kanji are belong to me, Heisig. And just remember; I beat you.	The snake likes stealing pieces from mosaics, so if you notice your mosaic has a piece missing, that’s a sign of the snake.	<img src="巳.png">
綺	ornate	thread, strange	Do I write the simple and officially approved 奇麗 or the ornate 綺麗 for beauty?
